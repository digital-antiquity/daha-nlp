 The ceramic samples from the Cholla Butte site were selected 
from collections curated at the Arizona State Museum. They were 
excavated by William Wasley in 1966, apparently in anticipation 
of construction activities in the Pima Industrial Park. No report on 
this work has been found in the archives at the museum.
