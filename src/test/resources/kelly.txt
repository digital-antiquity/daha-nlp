Introduction

Regional demographic movements during the mid 13th-14th centuries signaled 
corresponding changes to social and economic networks throughout the American 
Southwest. In the high mesa country of central Arizona large, masonry pueblos were 
constructed around AD 1250-1300 overlooking the vertical walls of Perry Mesa, in the 
Bloody Basin, and along the middle Verde River valley (Figure 1). As these settlement 
clusters coalesced, a 45 km expanse of empty land opened between the upland pueblos 
and the densely packed Hohokam population centers in the Phoenix Basin.
