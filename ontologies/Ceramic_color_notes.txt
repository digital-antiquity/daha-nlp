Talking about R/B or other ceramic abbreviations

It sort of depends on the area.  For the types from Pueblo country B is black, but in southern Hohokam land (Tucson), they usually use R/Br.  But
if there is a Rillito R/B it is Red on Brown.  However in the Phoenix area the decorated types are buffware so, Sacaton R/Bu (or possibly R/B) is Red on Buff.
Anyway, the point is, it depends on the type what B means.
 
There are three issues color, and spelled out or not, and capitalization.
 
Colors
B=Black usually maybe could be Buff or Brown
W=white
R=red
Gl=glaze
Poly=Polychrome
Pl
 
Orinarily the abbreviated colors would not have periods.  I donâ€™t recall seeing, for example B./W.  But you might have St Johns Poly or St Johns Poly.
 
Spelled out
B/W, Black on White, Black-on-white are all equivalent
 
Capitalization
Any capitalization will do on the colors.  For the type name, should always be capitalized.
 
A few other things
Could have St. Johns or St Johns
