In the American Southwest , intrusive pottery composed of temper and <START:material> clay <END> that originated elsewhere is acommonly cited archaeological signature for exchange and interaction among settlements ( e .g .
 In particular , we would expect local production to be marked by temper dominated by the basaltic sands eroded from the c.100 m-thick Late Miocene sub-alkaline <START:material> basalt <END> flows that cap the entire mesa ( Leighty , 1997 , p . 121-129 ) .
Plainware pottery constitutes the primary <START:material> ceramic <END> vessels that were produced and used by the inhabitants on Perry Mesa and surrounding regions .
In addition to the <START:material> basalt <END> that covers Perry Mesa , outcrops of <START:material> granite <END> and <START:material> schist <END> are also exposed in the steep river canyons that surround the mesa ( Lindgren , 1926 ; Jaggar and Palache , 1905 ; Wilson et al . , 1958 ) .
Local pottery production may be signaled by temper dominated by eroded <START:material> basalt <END> or by amixture of eroded <START:material> basalt <END> and small parts weathered <START:material> granite <END> that has washed down stream from <START:material> Precambrian granite <END> exposures to the north .
Further up the Verde River , the terrain becomes more mountainous and is characterized by basalt-capped mesas separated by gorges cut through <START:material> Precambrian granite <END> and metamorphic rocks ( Pearthree , 1993 ; Royce and Wadell , 1970 ) ( Figure 3 ) .
The electron microprobe was used to examine ten sherds from sites on Perry Mesa to determine if the pyroxene grains in their temper are derived from the <START:material> basalt <END> flows that cap the mesa , or if they are from the plutonic units that are located along the mesa edges .
In addition to the granite sand temper groups , sherd temper , sand consisting of a mixture of <START:material> schist <END> and <START:material> granite <END> , and sand consisting of a mixture of <START:material> schist <END> and phyllite temper were identified .
The temper compositions of samples from the western Perry Mesa sites of Pueblo la Plata , Richinbar and Pato Pueblo were dominated by granitic sand characterized by large , relatively unaltered <START:material> quartz <END> and plagioclase feldspar grains ( <START:material> Granite <END> I ) , and a granitic
Pottery samples from Pueblo Pato were particularly associated with the <START:material> Granite <END> I reference group .
The eastern Perry Mesa sites of Las Mujeres and Big Rosalie , on the other hand , were dominated by a mixture of <START:material> schist <END> and arkosic sands ( <START:material> Schist <END> & <START:material> Granite <END> ) .
<START:material> Temper Reference Group Main Characteristics Granite <END> I Characterized by large , relatively unaltered <START:material> quartz <END> and plagioclase feldspar
Large pieces of <START:material> biotite <END> are present as well as large , altered mafic grains .
<START:material> Schist <END> and Granite Smaller grain size than other reference groups .

<START:material> Schist <END> and <START:material> Phyllite <END> Large pieces of <START:material> schist <END> and <START:material> phyllite <END> dominate the temper .
Sherd Temper Characterized by sherd temper as well as a variety of other lithic grains , including <START:material> basalt <END> .

<START:material> Schist <END> & <START:material> Phyllite <END> , h ) .
Samples from Dugan in the Bloody Basin were predominantly composed of the same <START:material> schist <END> and phyllite temper group identified in some samples from Pueblo La Plata .
Samples from Tuzigoot were primarily tempered with fragments of sherds or 'grog ' that were mixed with a variety of other lithic grains including <START:material> basalt <END> .
Five of the samples from Pueblo la Plata were petrographically linked with the <START:material> Granite <END> I temper reference group and three were linked with the Granite II reference group .
Both samples from Richinbar were ascribed to the <START:material> Granite <END> I reference group .
Optical petrography and electron microprobe analysis established that Perry Mesa plainware pottery was tempered with materials such as <START:material> granite <END> and <START:material> schist <END> that were unavailable on the mesa top .
A small group of seven samples contained one or two inclusions of <START:material> basalt <END> , but not in the quantities expected if the sherds had been tempered with the basaltic sands derived from the <START:material> basalt <END> flows that cap Perry Mesa .
In addition , microprobe analysis of the mafic minerals in Perry Mesa plainware temper suggested that they do not derive from <START:material> basalt <END> .
The dominant temper groups used to produce Perry Mesa plainwares , <START:material> Granite <END> I and <START:material> Schist <END> & <START:material> Granite <END>  could have derived from the <START:material> schist <END> and granite bedrock underlying the basalt lava flows .
Sand and rock samples collected along the side of Perry Mesa beneath Pueblo Pato closely match the composition of the <START:material> Granite <END> I temper group .
In addition , extensive schist deposits interbedded with granite plutons are present to the south of Perry Mesa , and could have provided the mixture of <START:material> granite <END> and schist sands that characterize the <START:material> Granite <END> & Schist temper reference group .
If sands collected from these locales closely match the <START:material> Granite <END> I and the <START:material> Schist <END> & Granite temper groups , we can be reasonably sure that these materials are associated with the local production of plainwares on Perry Mesa .
However , tempering materials in Perry Mesa pottery were consistent with nearby <START:material> granite <END> and schist outcrops below the mesa top , and were possibly derived from these sources .
The integrity of our reference groups would be supported by an association between <START:material> clay <END> compositional groups and petrographically defined temper varieties .
For example , three granite-tempered sherds categorized as <START:material> Granite <END> I were among the samples analyzed from Montezuma 's Castle ( see Table 2 ) .
<START:material> Granite <END> I specimens have been tentatively associated with production on Perry Mesa and the presence of Perry Mesa pottery at sites along the middle Verde River would imply closer connections between the two areas than we have surmised ( Figure 4) .
<START:material> Granite <END> I sherds are characterized by granitic sand consisting largely of unaltered <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar grains that set them apart from all of the other temper groups in our analysis .
If so , the clay chemistry of the three <START:material> Granite <END> I sherds at Montezuma 's Castle , as measured by the microprobe , should be distinctive from that of the <START:material> clay <END> used to fabricate the <START:material> Granite <END> I sherds recovered from the Perry Mesa pueblos .

<START:material> Modeled clay <END> and sherd spindle whorls are described and compared to other like assemblages .
 Dr. John Dennett , Jr. , was a well-known physician who by 1917 was president of the company that ran the Hassayampa Creamery in Phoenix ; Phillip M Miller was an important official in Yuma ; Frank M. Murphy was the president of the Santa Fe , Prescott , and Phoenix Railroad and president of the Bank of Arizona in Prescott ; Sharlot M. Hall had been the Territorial Historian and later would <START:material> lead <END> the fight to restore the original Governor 's mansion in Prescott ( Maxwell 1982 ) ; and Robert H. Forbes was a Professor of Agriculture , University of Arizona ( McClintock 1916 ) .
 It is quite probable that further research will <START:material> lead <END> to discoveries of much greater importance—as the work has thus far been confined to the extreme sides or edges of the mounds , and valuables would probably be deposited at or near the center .
 This is probably when a <START:material> schist <END> slab-lined pit and Pithouses 4 and 5 were excavated .
 .uncovered a cremation~with a <START:material> copper <END> bell—in the native soil underlying one of the rooms .
 looking north , with Mound B in the background ] for the full width of the ruin , & down to the lower margin of the print , the top soil had been removed in order to obtain <START:material> caliche <END> for the structure .
 Many of these may be <START:material> caliche <END> borrow pits , but the report does not permit the testing of this inference ( see Yablon 1981 ) .
 Weak though they are , the data also <START:material> lead <END> to the suggestion that the large "depression " at La Ciudad ( Figures 3.3 and 3.4 ) was shaped into a central plaza in the late Colonial or Sedentary periods .
 One , which I have called Micaceous Red-on-buff , is a thinner superior ware , highly micaceous and characterized by delicate tints of salmon , gray , silver , <START:material> copper <END> , etc .
 Together with the report of Vahki Plain and Estrella Red-on-gray pottery by Peter Pilles ( 1967 ) north of St . Luke 's Hospital , the data from Wl , W2 , and W6 <START:material> lead <END> to the inference that the original center of the early Pioneer settlement was in the area under the Hospital and immediately around it .
 In this level and area of the mound no solid walls have been found , so the various floor levels encountered were parts of either pit-dwellings or surface dwellings of <START:material> wood <END> or fragile construction .

 •Troces of Floor 10 <START:material> Clay <END>
 A 5 inch ( 13 centimeter ) layer of <START:material> caliche <END> containing few sherds was then laid down to create a hard , clean surface ( Floor 3 ) .
 Level 15 was a 6 inch ( 15 centimeter ) thick layer of nearly sterile <START:material> caliche <END> capped
 Levels 26 to 30 ( 33 inches [80 centimeters ] ) were in a large trash-filled pit dug into the original ground surface to a depth of 17 feet 9 inches ( 5.3 meters ) , perhaps to remove <START:material> caliche <END> .
 <START:material> Stone <END> exposed in the walls offers examples of the <START:material> schist <END> and <START:material> cinnabar <END> from the Squaw Peak region , Lime [indurated <START:material> caliche <END> ] deposits not obtainable ( to the writer 's knowledge ) from closer than the Pueblo Grande area which is four miles [6.4 kilometers ] from La Ciudad , and granite rocks which could have come from this last named area if not from the Salt River Mountains 8 miles [12.8 kilometers ] south of Phoenix .
 The sources of the <START:material> stone <END> were indicated by the kind and grade of <START:material> stone <END> and revealed localities of from four to nine miles [6.4 to 14.4 kilometers ] distant .
 <START:material> Caliche <END> in large size from Pueblo Grande [and ] diorite rocks from the Salt River bed about 2 miles [3.2 kilometers ] south .
 <START:material> Stone <END> was also used to construct the retaining walls of the Pueblo Grande mound ( Pueblo Grande files ) .
 2. Above this basal floor is a 15-inch ( 45 centimeter ) stratum of ashy trash with alayer of <START:material> clay <END> near its middle .
 ( <START:material> Coursed Caliche <END>
 The thin zone of water-laid <START:material> clay <END> and silt above the ash ( see Figure 5.1 ) then may be due to the erosion of the remnant walls after this structure burned .
 Capping the trash is a 7-inch ( 18 centimeter ) layer of "hard <START:material> clay <END> " on top
 The southerly dip of the "hard <START:material> clay <END> " layer suggests that it may have sloped down in a smooth curve from the top of the original platform mound , dropping about 1.5 feet ( 45 centimeters ) over 1.5 feet ( 45 centimeters ) .
 ( Figure 5.2 ) , a layer of ash partly mixed with sand and silt , and then a 6-inch ( 15 centimeter ) layer of clean silt and <START:material> caliche <END> that formed the base for Rooms 5 and 18 . Probably correlated with this stratum is a 3-inch ( 8 centimeter ) zone between the massive retaining wall and the coursed-caliche wall of Rooms 5 and 18 . Somewhat farther north and west ( see Figure 4.2 ) , this zone is said to be 1 foot 2 inches ( 35 centimeters ) thick .
 The balance , or upper , part of the structure was probably chiefly <START:material> wood <END> and due to the paucity of postholes found on the inside of
 Many of the houses had been burnt , but no reed impressions on hardened <START:material> clay <END> was [sic ] found to indicate adobe plastering of the outside walls .

 They also had a much higher diversity of exotic or ritual items and a high diversity of <START:material> shell <END> .
 Judging by the distribution of slate and ceramic discs as well as the modeled <START:material> clay <END>
 One interesting find was what Fewkes ( 1912:98 ) interpreted as a shrine in the southwest corner of Mound B : "in it were found fragments of <START:material> copper <END> and many strangely formed stones . "
 shell disc occurred at the neck and a marvelously shaped bar of translucent <START:material> quartz <END> was found in a rodent burrow in the east wall of Room 1 , at a point eighteen inches [45 centimeters ] north of the grave .
 Only skull cap and another <START:material> bone <END> found in disturbed dirt near the center of Room 1 .
 At his left , in front of his face , was a stack of fragmentary mortuary vessels , beginning with a corroded Redware bowl [red interior ] containing a pecked discoidal <START:material> stone <END> .
 Above this was aRedware ladle with red interior con tain ing an unworked mano-shaped <START:material> stone <END> .
 Only the adults had associated tools ( manos , axe fragment , discoidal <START:material> stone <END> ) , whereas a "female " juvenile ( X7 ) had a high-grade Turquoise_set ( mosaic plaque ? ) , a female adult (XI9 ) had an obsidian arrowhead associated with it ( see Appendix III-B) , both of which may indicate ritual beliefs .
 The body was covered with <START:material> hematite <END> , a chunk of which was found under a Salt Red smudged bowl [B12-2] located to the right of the cranium ...Of course , the
 An infant was buried near the eastern retaining wall of the mound next to amultiple canid cremation that contained only canid long bones , a mano , a stone axe , and a small polished <START:material> stone <END> ( Doyel 1974 :139 ) .
 contained a plain <START:material> mica <END> tempered scoop .
 In doing so , the <START:material> hair <END> ornament...was found lying behind the head .
 In agrave 800 feet [240 meters ] northeast of the central building , 200 beads were found , half of them <START:material> Catlinite <END> .
 The pipestone ( <START:material> Catlinite <END> ) may have come from the Prescott or upper Verde areas ( Fish 1974 ; Haury 1976 ) .
 While usually the infant was buried under the floor of the clan-castle , yet one infant of a few days old was placed inside a 24-inch [60 centimeter ] flat earthen bowl with a turritella <START:material> shell <END> on its breast ; this came from northeast of the building [ Mound A?] . Nearby was a woman , over whose head lay an inverted 16-inch [40 centimeter ] flat bowl ; while beside another was an olla 17 inches [43 centimeters ] high .
 Mortuary objects include a polishing <START:material> stone <END> , a fantastically weathered ceremonial <START:material> stone <END> , bracelet fragments , and other <START:material> shell <END> .
 Mortuary offerings consisted of the bottom of a plain bowl containing a hammerstone , a fragment of burned bracelet and petunculus [Glycymeris ] <START:material> shell <END> , a large and a small burned rectangular bordered slate or "tablet " [palette] , both in fragments and not complete .
 Fragments of two large plain bowls were clustered over a clumsy cup made of a paste of pulverized burned <START:material> bone <END> [probably human] .
 appears to be entirely of burnt <START:material> bone <END> .
 That the <START:material> bone <END> used in the paste was human <START:material> bone <END> is very reasonable , considering that cremated human bones were found scattered all about it and that it was the center of the deposit .
 An elaborate range of ritual paraphernalia was introduced ( palettes , carved <START:material> stone <END> bowls , carved <START:material> shell <END> ) , and the practice became much more pervasive .
 Following the <START:material> lead <END> of Schmidt ( 1928:281 ) and the Gladwins ( 1929a , 1930b ) , Emil Haury ( 1945 ) argued against Cushing 's hypothesis , inferring instead a multi-ethnic population of indigenous Hohokam and foreign Saladoans who migrated from the Tonto basin to the Phoenix area .
 They also found a <START:material> stone <END> lined pit ; its only worked <START:material> stone <END> had been hammered to circular form and placed in the bottom of a hole three feet [90 centimeters ] deep and on its edge , [set in flaring form] , a wall of slabs rising level with the surface , while surrounding all was a collar of flat stones .
 We have found many of these pits among the ruins ; the only worked <START:material> stone <END> is that on the bottom ; the Henness people have four of the bottom stones all of <START:material> granite <END> , two feet [60 centimeters ] across and five inches [13 centimeters ] thick .
 It contained cholla cactus <START:material> pollen <END> and was lined with heavy slabs of <START:material> Oracle granite <END> which must have been transported from quarries at least 8 miles ( 12.8 kilometers ) away ( Doyel 1974 :137 ) .
 Concretions , quartz crystals , strangely shaped stones , slate palettes , carved <START:material> stone <END>
 One 4-inch [10 centimeter ] carving of hard <START:material> stone <END> portrayed a duck in whose back was the usual metate .
 <START:material> Shell <END> , turquoise , <START:material> obsidian <END> , red <START:material> argillite <END> ( pipestone ) , quartz-agate , copper bells and ores , cinnabar <START:material> schist <END> , and a wide variety of ceramic types ( Table 4.3 ) are among the artifacts at La Ciudad that must have originated somewhere outside of the Phoenix basin .
 Except that two Apache tears ( <START:material> obsidian <END> ) were found in trash , all of the same kinds of artifacts made from these materials were found in more or less comparable numbers both on and off the mound .
 Shell bracelets , quartz-agate arrow points , and Turquoise_beads apparently were more frequent in contexts off Mound A , but most Turquoise_was in Classic contexts , as was most <START:material> obsidian <END> .
 Burials contained the highest frequencies per occurrence of most exotic classes , especially of <START:material> shell <END> .
 In particular , a detailed and systematic study of all known specimens of Turquoise_mosaic work would be an invaluable contribution , especially since trace-element analyses of the <START:material> Turquoise_and argillite <END> that occur on them may serve to pin down exact sources of supply .
 regional reorganization , stimulated in part by an escalation of warfare , led by the middle Classic Period ( A.D. 1250-1350 ) to the negotiation of military alliances that were cemented by elite intermarriages ( this volume ; see also Wilcox 1987a ) .
 <START:material> Stone <END> and large sherds whorls may have been used to spin agave fiber .
 The first question that must be addressed is , what were these artifacts used to do ? Were the modeled <START:material> clay <END> "bead " whorls used in the same way and for the same purposes as the sherd or stone discs ?
 At another site , AZ T :4:8 ( ASM) , 31 modeled <START:material> clay <END> bead whorls and 27 perforated slate discs were found ( Gumerman and Spoerl 1980 :146 ) .
 Cotton is insect pollinated , which means its <START:material> pollen <END> is rarely preserved in archaeological sites ( Bohrer 1977 ; Gasser and Miksicek 1985 ) .
 As at Snaketown and Las Cremaciones , dirt may have been removed from the area for use in nearby mounds , making the underlying <START:material> caliche <END> artificially close to the surface ( see Wilcox et al . 1981 ; Wilcox 1985 ) .

In the American Southwest , intrusive pottery composed of temper and <START:material> clay <END> that originated elsewhere is acommonly cited archaeological signature for exchange and interaction among settlements ( e .g .
In particular , we would expect local production to be marked by temper dominated by the basaltic sands eroded from the c.100 m-thick Late Miocene sub-alkaline <START:material> basalt <END> flows that cap the entire mesa ( Leighty , 1997 , p . 121-129 ) .
Plainware pottery constitutes the primary <START:material> ceramic <END> vessels that were produced and used by the inhabitants on Perry Mesa and surrounding regions .
In addition to the <START:material> basalt <END> that covers Perry Mesa , outcrops of <START:material> granite <END> and <START:material> schist <END> are also exposed in the steep river canyons that surround the mesa ( Lindgren , 1926 ; Jaggar and Palache , 1905 ; Wilson et al . , 1958 ) .
Local pottery production may be signaled by temper dominated by eroded <START:material> basalt <END> or by
amixture of eroded <START:material> basalt <END> and small parts weathered <START:material> granite <END> that has washed down stream from <START:material> Precambrian granite <END> exposures to the north .
Further up the Verde River , the terrain becomes more mountainous and is characterized by basalt-capped mesas separated by gorges cut through <START:material> Precambrian granite <END> and metamorphic rocks ( Pearthree , 1993 ; Royce and Wadell , 1970 ) ( Figure 3 ) .
The electron microprobe was used to examine ten sherds from sites on Perry Mesa to determine if the pyroxene grains in their temper are derived from the <START:material> basalt <END> flows that cap the mesa , or if they are from the plutonic units that are located along the mesa edges .
In addition to the granite sand temper groups , sherd temper , sand consisting of a mixture of <START:material> schist <END> and <START:material> granite <END> , and sand consisting of a mixture of <START:material> schist <END> and phyllite temper were identified .
The temper compositions of samples from the western Perry Mesa sites of Pueblo la Plata , Richinbar and Pato Pueblo were dominated by granitic sand characterized by large , relatively unaltered <START:material> quartz <END> and plagioclase feldspar grains ( <START:material> Granite <END> I ) , and a granitic
Pottery samples from Pueblo Pato were particularly associated with the <START:material> Granite <END> I reference group .
The eastern Perry Mesa sites of Las Mujeres and Big Rosalie , on the other hand , were dominated by a mixture of <START:material> schist <END> and arkosic sands ( <START:material> Schist <END> & <START:material> Granite <END> ) .
Large pieces of <START:material> biotite <END> are present as well as large , altered mafic grains .
<START:material> Schist <END> and Granite Smaller grain size than other reference groups .
Charcaterized by <START:material> schist <END> mixed with heavily weathered arkosic sands .
<START:material> Schist <END> and <START:material> Phyllite <END> Large pieces of <START:material> schist <END> and <START:material> phyllite <END> dominate the temper .
Sherd Temper Characterized by sherd temper as well as a variety of other lithic grains , including <START:material> basalt <END> .
Volcanics Temper dominated by a mixture of porphyritic <START:material> basalt <END> with vitrophyric texture and fine-grained , felty volcanics .
Samples from Dugan in the Bloody Basin were predominantly composed of the same <START:material> schist <END> and phyllite temper group identified in some samples from Pueblo La Plata .
Samples from Tuzigoot were primarily tempered with fragments of sherds or 'grog ' that were mixed with a variety of other lithic grains including <START:material> basalt <END> .
Five of the samples from Pueblo la Plata were petrographically linked with the <START:material> Granite <END> I temper reference group and three were linked with the Granite II reference group .
Both samples from Richinbar were ascribed to the <START:material> Granite <END> I reference group .
Optical petrography and electron microprobe analysis established that Perry Mesa plainware pottery was tempered with materials such as <START:material> granite <END> and <START:material> schist <END> that were unavailable on the mesa top .
A small group of seven samples contained one or two inclusions of <START:material> basalt <END> , but not in the quantities expected if the sherds had been tempered with the basaltic sands derived from the <START:material> basalt <END> flows that cap Perry Mesa .
In addition , microprobe analysis of the mafic minerals in Perry Mesa plainware temper suggested that they do not derive from <START:material> basalt <END> .
The dominant temper groups used to produce Perry Mesa plainwares , <START:material> Granite <END> I and <START:material> Schist <END> & <START:material> Granite <END> , could have derived from the <START:material> schist <END> and granite bedrock underlying the basalt lava flows .
Sand and rock samples collected along the side of Perry Mesa beneath Pueblo Pato closely match the composition of the <START:material> Granite <END> I temper group .
In addition , extensive schist deposits interbedded with granite plutons are present to the south of Perry Mesa , and could have provided the mixture of <START:material> granite <END> and schist sands that characterize the <START:material> Granite <END> & Schist temper reference group .
If sands collected from these locales closely match the <START:material> Granite <END> I and the <START:material> Schist <END> & <START:material> Granite <END> temper groups , we can be reasonably sure that these materials are associated with the local production of plainwares on Perry Mesa .
However , tempering materials in Perry Mesa pottery were consistent with nearby <START:material> granite <END> and <START:material> schist <END> outcrops below the mesa top , and were possibly derived from these sources .
The integrity of our reference groups would be supported by an association between <START:material> clay <END> compositional groups and petrographically defined temper varieties .
For example , three granite-tempered sherds categorized as <START:material> Granite <END> I were among the samples analyzed from Montezuma 's Castle ( see Table 2 ) .
<START:material> Granite <END> I specimens have been tentatively associated with production on Perry Mesa and the presence of Perry Mesa pottery at sites along the middle Verde River would imply closer connections between the two areas than we have surmised ( Figure 4) .
<START:material> Granite <END> I sherds are characterized by granitic sand consisting largely of unaltered <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar grains that set them apart from all of the other temper groups in our analysis .

First among them was the question , were <START:material> ceramic <END> vessels made at Grewe ?
Thousands of <START:material> ceramic <END> vessels were used , broken , and discarded there .
Our rough-sort analysis ( see below ) show ed that the vast majority of the Grewe pottery contained coarse­ grained mica <START:material> schist <END> , a raw material that was not readily available in the Grewe vicinity .
Miksa 's study of the geological landscape in the middle Gila River valley dem onstrated that the village was situated in a portion of the valley where sources of the <START:material> schist <END> were absent ( Chapter 2 ) .
If there were local potters at the settlement who regu­ larly fabricated <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered pots , then they must have gone to some trouble acquiring raw <START:material> schist <END> for their craft .
In essence , therefore , the circumstances reduce the situation to one of three unlikely possibilities : either large numbers of pots w ere custom arily transported to Grewe , massive amounts of <START:material> schist <END> were brought from distance sources , or some combination of both .
Furtherm ore , if we assume that most decorated pots ( nearly all of which contained mica <START:material> schist <END> ) were made in the Gila River valley , then perhaps an even larger vessel inventory moved north ­ ward from the Gila area to the Salt River com munities .
Finally , analyses of raw <START:material> schist <END> that may have been intended for use in pottery making and some tools that possibly functioned to make pottery , w ere also undertaken in conjunction with some pottery-m aking replication studies .
Also , intrusive pottery as well as clay objects , such as raw <START:material> clay <END> from archaeological contexts , molded spindle whorls , and figurine fragments , were identified and set aside for subse­ quent separate analyses .
Red-slipped ceramics that had a thin , polished , pinkish brown slip , contained abundant amounts of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> , and lacked an interior smudge were classified as Vahki Red in accordance with Haury 's ( Gladwin et al . 1937 ) type description .
Sacaton Red sherds w ere character ­ ized by a thick , soft , raspberry red slip almost exclusively on the interior surface , and abundant am ounts of the <START:material> mica <END> - rich <START:material> schist <END> ( see Gladwin et al . 1937 ) .
These Classic period cases were further classified on the basis of whether or not they contained coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .
The plainware pieces were subdivided by temper alone , as having either a presence or absence of mica <START:material> schist <END> .
The texture of mica schist grades between a coarse grain , characterized by large and individual mica platelets , and a fine grain , associated with <START:material> phyllite <END> .
A distinction between <START:material> schist <END> and <START:material> phyllite <END> was not attem pted for the rough-sort analysis .
For the rough sort , other m iscella­ neous temper varieties , primarily those with undifferenti- atedcom positions of sand , constituted the plainware pottery categorized as lacking mica <START:material> schist <END> .
Raw clay specimens , intrusive sherds , and objects of <START:material> clay <END> ( such as figurines , molded spindle whorls , and construction daub ) were not included in the rough-sort counts .
Notes :1 excludes clay objects that were not part of pots , such as figurines , raw <START:material> clay <END> , and construction daub;2 either redware or plainware ; 3 includes decorated or incised

The breakdown of the temper data showed that almost all of the Grewe plainware and redware sherds contained rock fragments categorized as coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .
As explained in Chapter 4 , some of these cases were reclassified as either " silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , " "other <START:material> phyllite <END> , " or "other <START:material> schist <END> , " for the detailed analyses , but their counts were relatively small .
The temper in the buffware and grayware pottery was not systematically recorded , but we can confidently state that almost all of the decorated pieces also contained mica <START:material> schist <END> ( see also Chapter 4) .
Grewe and the Classic period sites were situated in a part of the middle Gila River valley where the bedrock units and wash sands did not include the coarse-grained mica-rich rock type (or , for that matter , other <START:material> schist <END> and phyllite types ) .
However , the characterization of schist-tempered pottery is much more difficult than that of sand-tempered wares , because the <START:material> schist <END> used to temper pottery in central and southern Arizona comes from widely scattered outcrops of very similar material .
Samples of <START:material> schist <END> collected from the site and pieces of <START:material> schist <END> rem oved from schist-tempered sherds w ere then compared to the source data .
In consultation with archaeologist Susan Wells , we applied the available monies to collect samples from a wider area in an effort to increase our know ledge of the <START:material> schist <END> ­ bearing sands and bedrock sources of <START:material> schist <END> that could have been available to people inhabiting the region around CGRNM .
<START:material> Pinal Schist <END> is the oldest rock unit in the study area , dating to approxim ately 1700 m illion years ago ( Ma ) .
The granitoid rocks make up the bulk of many of these mountain ranges and include rocks such as <START:material> granite <END> , granodiorite , <START:material> diorite <END> , monzonite , and syenogranite in a variety of textural varia­ tions from holocrystalline to porphyritic and from fine to coarse grained .
Most com mon are "blue quartzites " associated with <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> , but limited exposures of quartzite and lim estone do occur in the Santan and Sacaton mountains , and in the <START:material> gravel <END> of the Queen Creek and Florence/Ninety- six Hills areas .
Finally , Tertiary volcanics in the Superstition Mountains , Santan Mountains , and at Picacho Peak provide the rem aining major rock types available in the middle Gila R iver valley , including rhyolite , ash flow tuffs , dacite , and <START:material> basalt <END> among others .

The source of most of the coarser-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> used in both plainware and buffware pottery in the middle Gila River valley is " <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> , " a name given to a group
In order to understand the distribution and lithology of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> , it helps to first discuss the historical recognition of the <START:material> schist <END> as a terrane , or group of rocks related by age and tectonic origin .
This is followed by a description of the various lithologic units included in <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> , a summary of the current geologi­ cal literature on the history , age , and origin of the bedrock units , and a discussion of the extent of Pinal Schist outcrops in Arizona .
Once this background is in place , it is possible to discuss the sampling and characterization of the <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> as a temper resource .
The Recognition of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> as a Terrane and its Geographic Extent
<START:material> Pinal Schist <END> was first described by Ransome ( 1903 :23 ) , who recorded outcrops of <START:material> schist <END> in the Pinal Mountains of central Arizona .
The Pinal Schist type section includes schist bodies that range in size from inches to miles ; it is frequently difficult to delineate the <START:material> schist <END> and granitic rocks separately on a map ( Ransome 1 903 :24 ) .
DQueen Creek This petrofacies is characterized by <START:material> quartz <END> ( 20-40 % ) and feldspars ( 10-30 % ) and/or multicolored <START:material> granite <END> along with a wide variety of rock fragments .
A combination of pink , purple and buff felsite (5-15 % ) and <START:material> schist <END> ( grey , silver , gold , light green , all with black specks , 5-20 % ) is particularly distinctive .
2 % ) , a trace of <START:material> basalt <END> , and miscellaneous massive metamorphics (5-15 % ) in a wide variety of colors .
<START:material> EMineral Quartz <END> ( 20-30 % ) , foliated quartz (up to 5 % ) , and <START:material> schist <END> ( gold , silver , gray , with black or silver Mountain specks ; 20-45 % ) make up the bulk of these samples .
Traces of other rock types such as <START:material> granite <END>
and <START:material> basalt <END> occur .
LSuperstition This petrofacies consists of beige , pink , or purple+black felsite ( 10-35 % ) plus clear and white <START:material> Mountains quartz <END> ; clear , white , yellow , and pink feldspars , and white+clear+pink+/-yellow <START:material> granite <END> ( each
A Santan This petrofacies is characterized by white <START:material> granite <END> ( white+gray with black and/or green flecks ) Mountains greater than 40 % and <START:material> schist <END> > 10 % .
<START:material> The schist <END> may be very coarse-grained <START:material> muscovite <END> and <START:material> quartz <END> ,
or may be finer-grained , with tiny white <START:material> quartz <END> and/or feldspar , shiny silver <START:material> muscovite <END> , and flecks of black magnetite .
Accessory minerals in this petrofacies include free <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar , <START:material> biotite <END> , epidote , magnetite , and a few grains of chlorite .
BOlberg This petrofacies is characterized by the presence of both latite and <START:material> basalt <END> in addition to the essential white <START:material> granite <END> .
<START:material> Granite <END> and/or free <START:material> quartz <END> , feldspars , and <START:material> biotite <END> will be more abundant than the volcanic grains .
CTwin Buttes This petrofacies is characterized by white <START:material> granite <END> and its decomposition products (quartz , white feldspars ) in combination with a lesser amount of pink <START:material> granite <END> and its decomposition products (quartz , pink feldspars ) .
<START:material> Biotite <END> is present , latite and <START:material> basalt <END> are only rarely observed .
HSacaton This petrofacies is characterized by abundant coarse white <START:material> granite <END> along with <START:material> quartz <END> , plagioclase , Mountains and potassium feldspar derived from the <START:material> granite <END> .
<START:material> Biotite <END> is generally in the 2 to 10 % range .
abundance of minerals such as hornblende , magnetite , <START:material> muscovite <END> , epidote , chlorite , and sphene and rocks such as finer-grained hornblende <START:material> granite <END> and felsite is less than two percent , so overall it just looks like white <START:material> granite <END> with a bit of <START:material> biotite <END> .
JSacaton West This petrofacies is characterized by free minerals from coarse white <START:material> granite <END> in abundances between 10 and 40 percent , with lesser amounts of coarse white <START:material> granite <END> .
Finer-grained hornblende <START:material> granite <END> is 2-10 % .
Magnetite and <START:material> muscovite <END> are variable ; less than 2 percent in some samples but up to 4 or 5 percent in others .
Hornblende , <START:material> biotite <END> , epidote , and felsite each make up less than 2 % of the total volume of these samples .
The important differences between this petrofacies and the Sacaton Mountain petrofacies are the increase in the finer-grained <START:material> granite <END> and free magnetite and <START:material> muscovite <END> .
FFlorence This petrofacies is dominated by light-colored ( white+gray+yellow or pink ) <START:material> granite <END> and the <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspars from the <START:material> granite <END> .
Rock fragments such as felsite , <START:material> schist <END> , gneiss , <START:material> phyllite <END> , and metavolcanics do occur , but are generally less than 2 % .
GPicacho This petrofacies has <START:material> granite <END> (2-10 % ) and/or <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspars from <START:material> granite <END> ( 10 to 40 % each ) much like the Florence petrofacies .
The presence of the quartzite with <START:material> granite <END> or small rounded <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspars is the strongest indicator of
Mafic mineral are rare ; there are only traces of <START:material> mica <END> and epidote .__ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
This petrofacies is characterized by abundant <START:material> quartz <END> , with <START:material> granite <END> and feldspars only present ( 2­ 10 % ) .
<START:material> Schist <END> , and <START:material> muscovite <END> and magnetite from the <START:material> schist <END> , are rare .
Traces of hornblende , <START:material> biotite <END> , epidote , and red garnet may be visible .
MMilitary This petrofacies has abundant <START:material> quartz <END> , but <START:material> granite <END> is common in association with the <START:material> quartz <END> .
<START:material> Schist <END> and feldspars are present , other rock fragments and minerals ( magnetite , <START:material> biotite <END> , <START:material> muscovite <END> , chlorite , epidote , felsite , and quartzite ) are rare , but most occur in small percentages in the petrofacies .
The abundant <START:material> quartz <END> , along with <START:material> granite <END> and some <START:material> schist <END> are the best indicators of the petrofacies .
Following R ansom e 's definition of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> as a rock unit , much more quartz-m ica ( or chlorite-quartz-mica ) <START:material> schist <END> was recorded across central to southern Arizona and was attributed to <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> .
This led to several attem pts to define the limits of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> and to explain its relationship to other Early Proterozoic rock units and terranes in Arizona ( Anderson 1989a ; Condie and DeM alas 1985 ; Conway and Silver 1989 ; Copeland and Condie 1986 ; Keep 1996 ) .
I particularly agree with A nderson 's northern and northwestern boundaries for <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> but have not yet investigated the southeastern or w estern boundaries .
Swift ( 1987 :1 ) notes that the term <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> is imprecise and should be used only inform ally .
However , for lack of another name , <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> will be used to refer to Proterozoic marine deposits of central to southern Arizona .
<START:material> Pinal Schist <END> in the Pinal Mountains was described by Ransom e ( 1903 :25 ) as being generally light gray in color with a " silvery satiny luster " and textures that range from cryptocrystalline ( aphanitic ) slaty sericite schists through fine granular fissile rocks with a sugary texture , to im per ­ fectly cleavable crystalline m uscovite schists .
Microscopi­ cally they have a fairly simple m ineralogy , being aggregates of <START:material> quartz <END> and m uscovite ( or sericite , which is cryptocrystal­
line <START:material> muscovite <END> ) with m inor amounts of microcline or plagioclase , magnetite , zircon , tourmaline , hornblende , <START:material> biotite <END> , chlorite , and rarely , andalusite and sillimanite near granite contact zones .
Most of the m inor m inerals are present only in sm all amounts , but some , such as micro­ cline , are more abundant in the coarser samples , while others , such as tourm aline or <START:material> biotite <END> , may occur random ly in greater abundance ( Ransome 1903 :25-26 ) .
Subsequent reports added chlorite-quartz-m <START:material> uscovite schist <END> as a major variety of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> , with local feld - spathic <START:material> schist <END> , quartzite , and am phibolite units ( Lance 1959 ; Schmidt 1967 ) .
Also by this time , the term "phyllite " was being used to describe the finer-grained or aphanitic expressions of the <START:material> schist <END> ( e .g. , Erickson 1962 ) .
Recent petrographic descriptions of the rocks in <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> have done much to describe variations present at specific loca ­ tions and underscore the heterogeneity of rock units in this terrane .
Ransom e ( 1903 :27 ) first described <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> as originating from an arkosic sedim entary deposit with a probable volcanic com ponent .
The volcanic material in the rocks of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> is predom inantly sedimentary , derived from the erosion of Proterozoic volcanic mountain ranges ( Cooper and Silver 1964 ; Silver 1955 ) ; however , it is only locally abundant , and most of the submarine sediment deposits were derived from plutonic rock sources ( Condie and DeMalas 19 85 ) .
The original sedim ent varied from a <START:material> quartz <END> wacke (quartz grains in mud ) to a lithic wacke ( rock fragments in m ud ) , with some m udstones and quartzites ( Condie and DeM alas 1985 ) .

<START:material> Schist <END> were deposited in a tectonically formed oceanic basin or trench environm ent that was to the southeast of ancient volcanic belts now exposed in central Arizona .
Most sediments were deposited between 1710 and 1675 Ma ( Conway and Silver 1989 ) and were m etam orphosed into <START:material> schist <END> between approxim ately 1675 and 1625 Ma .
They were intruded into by plutonic igneous bodies such as M adera <START:material> Diorite <END> , <START:material> Ruin Granite <END> , and Johnny Lyon Granodiorite from 1640 to 1615 M a ( Conway and Silver 1989 ) .
The gradational contacts between deform ed granitic rocks ( the "granite- gneisses " ) and the <START:material> schist <END> often make it difficult to map a boundary betw een them .
Finally , basin and range faulting , and erosion of the resul­ tant mountain ranges , exposed <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> as the scattered terrane we see today .
Sampling and Characterization of the <START:material> Pinal Schist <END>
As noted above , <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> occurs in widely scattered outcrops , yet substantial variation can exist within each outcrop .
In devising a sampling strategy , we attem pted to find and sample all possible sources of <START:material> schist <END> in the middle Gila River valley .
The number of rock types , including several varieties of <START:material> schist <END> , were recorded for each sample , along with the number of examples of each type .
When viewed in a hand sample or at low magnification , the schist samples collected from the middle Gila River valley are generally w ell foliated , with <START:material> quartz <END> , <START:material> muscovite <END> , and plagioclase as major minerals , and magnetite , chlorite , or <START:material> biotite <END> as m inor minerals .
Occasional samples include <START:material> biotite <END> or tourm aline among the minor minerals .
Six examples of <START:material> schist <END> from different bedrock sources ( Gila , Pima , and Sacaton buttes , the Santan Mountains , the Goldfield Mountains , and Mineral Mountain ) were thin sectioned for petrographic analysis .
Inventory of Middle Gila River Valley Rock Samples that <START:material> Include Schist <END> or <START:material> Phyllite <END> .
Number of <START:material> Schist <END> or Phyllite Rocks
Portions of these six rocks were crushed and added to terra cotta <START:material> clay <END> , fired , thin sectioned , and point counted .
The intensity of the gold was related in part to the am ount of <START:material> mica <END> in the samples ; the Goldfield Mountain sample and the Pima Butte samples , which are the most micaceous of the schists , were very gold .
In the course of crushing the samples , it was observed that quartz-rich fragments of <START:material> schist <END> tended to " jum p " o ff the grinding surface , and that mica fragments were easily powdered even without being ground .
The volum e of each crushed sample was measured , then each sample was added to an equal volum e of terra cotta <START:material> clay <END> and mixed to form a homogenous paste that was patted
Point count parameters ( mineral and rock types ) used for this experiment were the same as those em ployed for the sand samples ( Table 2.2 ) , with the addition of a parameter for " Pinal Schist matrix , " which is massive to foliated cryptocrystalline <START:material> quartz <END> and sericite .
These micas are not present in a thin section of commercial , untempered terra cotta <START:material> clay <END> .
The three data sets ( rocks versus test tiles produced from fired or un fired <START:material> schist <END> ) display some interest ­ ing differences that provide inform ation about sample alteration due to crushing .
First , the test tiles uniform ly contain volcanic rock fragments from the <START:material> basalt <END> grinding implements ; these are , of course , absent from the metam or- phic raw material .
In the tiles made from unfired <START:material> schist <END> , volcanic rocks make up 1.4 percent to 6.3 percent of the sand-sized material ( =3.5 , 0 =1.9 ) ; in the tiles made from fired <START:material> schist <END> , volcanic rocks make up 0 to 1.8 percent of the sand-sized material ( =0.5 , 0 =0.7 ) .
both fired and unfired <START:material> schist <END> contain much less than the 50 percent of temper by volume m easured when the test tiles were made .
However , tiles produced from unfired <START:material> schist <END> have less sand-sized temper than those produced from fired <START:material> schist <END> ( 31 % to 39 % for the tiles produced from unfired <START:material> schist <END> , =34 % , 0 =3 % ; 38 to 42 percent for the tiles produced from fired <START:material> schist <END> , = 40 % , 0 =2 % ) .
This seems to result from crushing the micas to <START:material> clay <END> and silt sizes .
Finally , in addition to the com positional changes produced by crushing , the test tiles include potassium feldspar and <START:material> quartz <END> from the terra cotta <START:material> clay <END> .
Taken together , these data indicate that the process of crushing the <START:material> schist <END> changed the petrographic com position of the end product from that observed in the raw material ( see Mills et al . 1997 for a discussion of similar changes observed in crushing and processing volcanic materials ) .
A lthough the 10 percent loss in mass during crushing could not be m ineralogically quantified , it seems likely that the proportion of <START:material> mica <END> lost was greater than the proportion of fram ework silicates .
<START:material> Unfired schist <END> was harder to crush ; thus , compared to fired schist samples , unfired samples lost a greater proportion of micas , had a greater proportion of the sample reduced to below sand size , and had more fragments of the crushing implements in the paste .
In addition , even w here rudim entary qualitative differences can be recognized petrographically , the crushed <START:material> schist <END> seen as temper in clay pastes does not display all of the textural characteristics needed to separate bedrock schist sources , and crushing alters the proportion of sand-sized minerals in the <START:material> schist <END> .

She was successful in showing that samples of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> from Gila Butte and Pima Butte could be distinguished from one another using ICPS.
First , samples from the six sources used in the <START:material> schist <END> ­ crushing experim ent were divided in half .
In an analysis that included unknowns , the lack of definition of these deliberately variable groups could <START:material> lead <END> to the inappropriate assignm ent of unknowns to them .
We concluded that , even with the sm all am ount of <START:material> schist <END> recovered from archaeological samples , ICPS was an appropriate technique with which to pursue provenance identification .
Thus , an additional 43 raw material samples were subm itted for analysis , for a total of 108 samples of <START:material> schist <END> analyzed using ICPS.
In other words , at least one outcrop of <START:material> schist <END> in the Santan Mountains has a chemical signature that is unique compared to the rest of the Santan Mountains .
Phosphate was excluded because it can be elevated in archaeological sites ; thus , <START:material> schist <END> from sherds might not be comparable to its source material .
First , although the Gila Butte source has the largest number of members , this does not <START:material> lead <END> to a large number of samples from other groups being predicted
probability that should be used for this analysis , since we know that there are unsam pled sources of P inal <START:material> Schist <END> outside this group of middle Gila River valley samples .
As noted above , an initial test of the fired/unfired rock pairs showed that fired exam ples of <START:material> schist <END> could be matched to their unfired mates without exception .
Unfortunately , the vast majority of pottery at the Grewe site is tempered with <START:material> schist <END> , so much so that the sand petrofacies model — developm ent of which began long before pottery was available for analysis — seemed useless once the results of the rough-sort analysis of the pottery were known .
The temper in this pottery was seen to be primarily <START:material> schist <END> .
Finally , at the time the Grewe project was initiated , we did not have a good protocol for the quantitative separa­ tion of sand from <START:material> schist <END> .
In samples with multiple types of <START:material> schist <END> , the types were distinguished qualitatively by their internal texture and composition .
An initial microscopic survey of the tempers , along with aconsideration of possible pottery manufacture techniques , led us to believe that we needed to distinguish among several temper types : 1 ) sand ; 2 ) schist-bearing sand ; 3 ) crushed <START:material> schist <END> added to a sandy <START:material> clay <END> ; and 4 ) crushed <START:material> schist <END> and sand added to a non-sandy <START:material> clay <END> .
Em pirical data for the petrographic characteristics of different temper types was collected by examining two known sources of <START:material> schist <END> : sands that were collected for this project from Petrofacies E , the only petrofacies with common to abundant <START:material> schist <END> in the sand ; and the briquettes made for the schist-crushing experiment .
Petrographic Evidence for the Crushing of <START:material> Schist <END>
In a crushed <START:material> schist <END> , the maximum dimension of the schist fragments is usually very coarse sand to granule size ; however , there are num erous small fragments of <START:material> schist <END> that are texturally and com positionally similar to the larger grains .
In a crushed <START:material> schist <END> , the texture of the <START:material> schist <END> in any given briquette is hom ogeneous , with a limited range of textures and com positions .
Because of the platy nature of <START:material> schist <END> , grains that have been transported in streams do not becom e strongly rounded .
Some crushed schist grains have conchoidally fractured <START:material> quartz <END> and frayed mica grains .
Finely D issem inated <START:material> Mica <END> .
In the briquettes , we found tiny grains of <START:material> mica <END> disseminated throughout the paste .
<START:material> Clay <END> and/or silt-sized <START:material> mica <END> was not observed in Petrofacies E sands .
In the initial microscopic survey of 30 sherds from the Grewe site , we observed sherds with pastes rich in <START:material> mica <END> .
M any also had clay lumps that were free of <START:material> mica <END> .
Thus , the presence of finely dissem inated micas was accepted as an indicator of the addition of crushed <START:material> schist <END> to aclay .
In a briquette , it was common to find a few grains of volcanic rock from the mano or m etate used to crush the <START:material> schist <END> .
In some cases , thetemper com ponent appeared to be sand that m ight have been included in the <START:material> clay <END> ; in other cases it appeared to have been added .
One further complication was that qualitative observation of the bri­ quettes made with crushed <START:material> schist <END> indicated that some monocrystalline grains ( i .e . , free <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar ) were released during the crushing process .
Thus , the presence of monocrystalline grains of <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar is not a sufficient criterion for the identification of the additional temper com ponent as sand in a paste .
In a paste that con­ tains crushed <START:material> schist <END> , an additional temper com ponent was identified as sand using one or more of the following criteria :
In many sherds , the additional temper com ponent is much finer than the schist fraction , or it has a narrower range of grain sizes than the <START:material> schist <END> .
In many sherds , there is a temper com ponent that includes grain types that could not be derived from the <START:material> schist <END> .
grains cannot have come from a <START:material> schist <END> that does not contain potassium feldspar , while <START:material> granite <END> or a heterogeneous assortment of volcanic grains cannot have come from a <START:material> schist <END> under any circumstances .
Petrographic Evidence for the Presence of Sand in a <START:material> Clay <END>
To understand the range of pottery production technol­ ogy as well as possible , an attem pt was made to identify those sherds in which the natural <START:material> clay <END> contained sand , versus those in which sand had been intentionally added to anatural <START:material> clay <END> .
There are clay lumps in the paste that have the same color and birefringence as the <START:material> clay <END> in the paste but lack any clay- or silt-sized micas , <START:material> quartz <END> , feldspar o r other grains .
These lumps are interpreted as resulting from incom plete grinding of the <START:material> clay <END> ; that is , they are com positionally the same as the clay fraction that makes up the paste of the pottery , but they lack the added silt- and sand-sized com ponents of the paste .If this interpre ­ tation is correct , then the clay lumps could be com posi­ tionally characterized and compared to raw clay samples .
In a sample with no clay lumps , there are clay or silt-sized micas , <START:material> quartz <END> , feldspar , or other grains in the paste , but the com position of this very fine fraction is different from the com position of the sand ­ sized fraction .
For instance , a <START:material> clay <END> may include clay- to silt ­ sized w eathered micas , Iron_Oxides , and <START:material> quartz <END> , while the sand-sized fraction is rich in fresh-looking <START:material> quartz <END> , feldspars , and hornblende .
In general , the temper seen in the sherds at the Grewe site ranges from <START:material> schist <END> to sand m ixed with <START:material> schist <END> .
Some sherds had sand that may have been present in the <START:material> clay <END> , but most had sand that was added along with the <START:material> schist <END> .
In alm ost all cases , the <START:material> schist <END> was crushed and added to the paste ; only a few samples had <START:material> schist <END> that could have originated from schist-bearing sand deposits .
Plainware sherds tended to have much more abundant temper than buffware sherds , both in terms of having more plentiful grains of <START:material> schist <END> and in terms of having larger and more plentiful grains of non-schist sand .
The buffware sherds tended to have more clay lumps and often had large lumps of <START:material> caliche <END> that appear to have been added .2
22 , 25 ) ; and the presence of tourm aline in the <START:material> schist <END> of other samples , especially those found at La Ciudad ( pp . 25 , 29 ) .
The presence of varying amounts of sand in many samples complicated the point count data beyond the scope of this project , because minerals in sand were not counted separately from minerals in <START:material> schist <END> .
For instance , if the crosshair landed on aquartz grain in a <START:material> granite <END> , Weisman would have counted "granite , " whereas we would count "quartz . "
•Weism an 's m <START:material> uscovite schist <END> , biotite gneiss , augen gneiss , phyllonite , slate , and phyllite fields were added together to becom e the parameter " LM ATTP" ( i .e . , schists , gneisses , and phyllites ) .
Likewise , in our data set , the point count parameters LM A (quartz-feldspar-m ica aggregate ) , LMT (schist or gneiss ) , and LMTp ( <START:material> phyllite <END> ) were added together to make the summary parameter LMATTP.
The proportions were chosen based on the am ount of <START:material> quartz <END> ( .33 ) , plagioclase ( .35 ) , potassium feldspar ( .20 ) and other minerals ( .12 ) in sands derived from the <START:material> granite <END> in the Sacaton Mountains .
This procedure was chosen because sand from the <START:material> Sacaton Mountains granite <END> has no or very few grains from other rock sources , and the <START:material> Sacaton Mountains granite <END> is coeval with other central A rizona granites .
The ICPS analysis of the source rocks dem onstrates that we can use chemical com position data to define geographi­ cally significant groups of source materials for <START:material> schist <END> .
One way to im m ediately use the schist data is to apply it to pieces of <START:material> schist <END> recovered from archaeological sites .
Initially , data were available from the source rock ICPS study prior to the availability of <START:material> schist <END> from the Grewe site .
To test the possible applications of the ICPS technique , six samples of <START:material> schist <END> were selected from the M aricopa Road site , which is across the Gila R iver from Pima Butte but only 4 km away ( Table 2.12 ) .
<START:material> The schist <END> was thought to have been obtained for pottery production ( Lascaux and Ravesloot 1993 :44 ) .
<START:material> Only schist <END> that was thought to be coarse enough for temper material was examined .
The relatively h igh posterior probability scores for this sample ( compared to the remaining schist rocks recovered from the Grewe site ) and the com positional sim ilarity of this sample to Gila Butte rock samples suggest that the palette may well have been made of <START:material> Gila Butte schist <END> .
The question then becam e one of using petrographic analysis of the <START:material> schist <END> to identify the prove­ nance of the sherds .
The ICPS model of the schist sources in the middle Gila River valley is easily applied to pieces of <START:material> schist <END> recovered from archaeological sites , but less easily applied to the schist temper in sherds .
Petrographic evidence shows that crushed <START:material> schist <END> was used to temper pots , and that temper com position is related to factors other than provenance .
Unfortu­ nately , statistical analysis of the <START:material> schist <END> temper chemical data showed that the sherds clustered separately from either of the sampled raw schist sources ( W alsh-Anduze 1993c ) .
With only lim ited source inform ation available , Walsh-Anduze ( 1993c :92 ) concluded that her samples may have been produced using <START:material> schist <END> from Gila Butte as temper ; however , notched box plots of the data for her sherds compared to Gila Butte source samples show that the confidence notches for these two groups fail to overlap for six of 10 elements used in the discriminant analysis p re ­ sented here ( Al2O3 , Fe2O3 , MgO , TiO2 , Cr , V ) .
It seems possible that the schist fragments submitted for analysis were not free of <START:material> clay <END> and thus do not reflect the unadulterated schist temper , a potential problem that was noted by Walsh­ Anduze ( 1993c :92 ) .
To reduce the likelihood of sam ple contam ination by <START:material> clay <END> , we adopted a low-tech approach to temper removal .
Using the reasoning applied above to the source rocks , the Santan B com position group cannot be ruled out as a possible source for the <START:material> schist <END> in these sherds ( Table 2.15 ) .
A lthough the removal of <START:material> schist <END> from the sherds seemed to be working , we decided to test the process by making briquettes from known <START:material> clay <END> and schist samples and then
Briquettes w ere made with terra cotta <START:material> clay <END> and <START:material> schist <END> from five samples that had previously been subm itted for ICPS analysis .
The briquette made from <START:material> schist <END> GB-3 was split into four parts .
Two parts were w ashed in purified deionized water , one in a sodium hydroxide solution , and one in a Calgon solution , in an effort to rem ove the <START:material> clay <END> without picking out the <START:material> schist <END> from the <START:material> clay <END> .
The washing process sent much of the <START:material> mica <END> into solution without affect ­ ing the fired <START:material> clay <END> in the least , and some <START:material> mica <END> was lost to the
Samples were dried in an oven so that as much <START:material> mica <END> as possible could be recovered .
<START:material> Schist <END> was then rem oved from the four GB-3 samples and the other four briquettes using the same process as for the M aricopa Road sherds .
The briquettes were abundantly tempered with coarse pieces of crushed <START:material> schist <END> , and the ease of rem oval of the <START:material> schist <END> from the terra cotta <START:material> clay <END> was approxim ately the same as that from the M aricopa Road plainware sherds .
The com positional data suggest that the rem oval of uncontam inated <START:material> schist <END> from the <START:material> clay <END> was largely successful .
Thus , on the basis of raw data values and discriminant analysis predictions , we feel that the careful rem oval of <START:material> schist <END> from gently crushed sherds can be successful , but that the process needs to be done very carefully and the raw data must be examined for anom alies .
The source assignm ent for the <START:material> schist <END> removed from the 10 Grewe sherds submitted for analysis is shown in Table
tion , we conclude that the rem oval of <START:material> schist <END> from the sherds was apparently successful .
Furthermore , w e can rule out Gila Butte , Sacaton Butte , and the Santan B compo sition as potential sources for the <START:material> schist <END> in the sherds recovered from the Grewe site .
A dditional samples may <START:material> lead <END> us to define more petrofacies in some areas , or we may be able to confirm that some petrofacies have relatively hom ogeneous com positions over a wide area .
<START:material> Pinal Schist <END> is the source rock for the schist temper encountered in the middle Gila R iver valley .
Furtherm ore , the variability present at many outcrops of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> precludes the provenance character ­ ization of crushed schist temper by petrographic study of the
Notched box-and-whiskers p lot of A l2O3 , Fe2O3 , and MgO concentrations for rocks from Pima Butte ( Pim a Butte ) , sherds from the Grewe site that may have <START:material> schist <END> from Pima Butte ( M aybe Pim a Butte ) , and sherds from the Grewe site for which Pima Butte has been ruled out as a source ( Not Pima ) .
<START:material> schist <END> alone .
Finally , a schist-crushing experim ent showed that the process of crushing the <START:material> schist <END> changed the petrographic com position of the end product from that observed in the raw material , leading us to conclude that petrographic comparison of raw materials to crushed materials should be undertaken cautiously , and with potential alterations kept in mind .
The problems with the petrographic study of schist temper , and the success of a previous ICPS study of <START:material> schist <END> ( W alsh-Anduze 1993c ) led us to undertake an ICPS study
Notched box-and-whiskers p lot of TiO2 , M nO , and Ba concentrations for rocks from Pima Butte ( Pima Butte ) , sherds from the Grewe site that may have <START:material> schist <END> from Pima Butte ( M aybe Pim a Butte ) , and sherds from the Grewe site for which Pima Butte has been ruled out as a source ( Not Pima ) .
We noted above that the sand model was prem aturely abandoned as a means of characterizing temper provenance for the sherds because we had not developed a means for analyzing <START:material> schist <END> and sand com ponents of the temper sepa­ rately .
Qualitative petrographic study of sherds from the Grewe site and other middle Gila River valley sites showed that they have temper that ranges from <START:material> schist <END> to sand mixed with <START:material> schist <END> .
In alm ost all cases , the <START:material> schist <END> was crushed and added to the paste ; rarely , sherds were tempered with <START:material> schist <END> that originated from schist-bearing sand deposits .
Notched box-and-whiskers p lot of Cr , Li , V , and Zn concentrations for rocks from Pima Butte ( Pima Butte ) , sherds from the Grewe site that may have <START:material> schist <END> from Pima Butte ( M aybe Pim a Butte ) , and sherds from the Grewe site for which Pima Butte has been ruled out as a source ( Not Pima ) .
The ICPS model developed for the Pinal Schist sources was applied to samples of <START:material> schist <END> recovered from middle Gila River valley archaeological sites .
It may be that much of the <START:material> schist <END> and schist temper at Grewe comes from the poorly sampled Santan Mountains sources , or perhaps we m ust look to other areas or at complex social relationships to explain the provenance of pottery recovered from the Grewe site .
Dave Gregory , Jim Heidke , and Michael Wiley helped me track down obscure references for the discussions on "micaceous <START:material> schist <END> " terminology and origin of the Pinal Schist terrane .
2. <START:material> The caliche <END> interpreted as added to the paste occurs as coarse sand - to granule-sized grains of micrite , often with included silt- to fine-sand-sized <START:material> quartz <END> or feldspars .
This added <START:material> caliche <END> is in contrast to <START:material> caliche <END> interpreted as having been deposited in place in void spaces of the pottery .
The latter <START:material> caliche <END> is micrite , yet is amorphous in shape , with poorly defined boundaries and unfilled voids at the center .
Consequently , we know less about the loci and organization of production for the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered hallmarks of Hohokam culture associated with the settlements along the Gila R iver than we do about the ceramic types and varieties produced in the surrounding areas .
In the low er Salt R iver valley , previous results have dem onstrated a close association betw een <START:material> clay <END> and temper type , showing that the valley artisans tended to use the most readily available materials to produce their utilitarian pottery .
mica <START:material> schist <END> , a trait that typifies the utilitarian ware at various sites along the Gila River ( Haury 1976 ; Lascaux 1993 ; Rafferty 1982a ; Rice and Rafferty 1979 ) .
Unfortunately , the geological differences between the lower <START:material> Salt <END> and middle Gila river valleys did not bode well for the Grewe chemical study .
These analyses probably were negatively affected by the recipes of the ancient potters , which included <START:material> caliche <END> and possibly salt additives to the clay body ( see Chapter 7 ) and thereby altered the chemical signatures from the pottery fabric .
A close association between <START:material> clay <END> and temper type was dem onstrated , leading to the conclusion that the potters of the lower Salt River valley mostly used locally available materials for their craft .
The work for the M cDowell-to-Shea ( MTS ) project also included a first assessment of the coarse-grained <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware pottery from the middle Gila River valley ( Abbott 1995b ) .
A reference group from the Gila Butte site was assayed , which showed that the <START:material> clay <END>
fraction in those sherds was chemically distinct from the <START:material> clay <END> in the previously assayed reference groups from the Phoenix area .
The Queen Creek pottery was characterized by copious am ounts of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> and fragm ents of red sediment ( Kamilli 1993 ) that Antieau ( 1977 ) called red arkose .
Based on the geologi­ cal survey described by Miksa ( Chapter 2 ) , we know that mica <START:material> schist <END> was abundant along portions of Queen Creek where the red sediment also exists .
The microprobe assays dem on ­ strated that the clay com ponents in the Queen Creek sherds were chemically distinct from those from the Gila Butte site , further indicating that source-related chemical differences were extant within the area where mica <START:material> schist <END> was naturally found .
On the one hand , the modest variability in the geological terrain was less than optimal for discriminating pots made from different clay sources , and the detection lim its of the microprobe restricted the equipm ent to the m easurem ent of the main ingredients ( i .e . , aluminosilicates ) and some of the <START:material> clay <END> 's m inor impurities ( i .e . , the oxides of Na , Mg , K , Ca , Ti , and Fe ) .
Also , the previous microprobe results with <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware pottery did document a fairly wide range of chemical variation , holding out the prom ise of sufficient variability with which to distinguish between provenance-related plainware groups .
As noted by Miksa ( Chapter 2 ) , Grewe was situated in a portion of the Gila R iver valley where coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> was not naturally available .
The number of pottery production tools recovered was quite small , however , and mica <START:material> schist <END> was used by the Hohokam for other purposes besides temper , including the production of palettes , tabular knives , and jew elry ( e .g. , Haury 1 976 ) .
Because most of the plainware and buffware pottery from the middle Gila River valley was tempered with coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> , a reference group approach , based on differences in temper , was im possible for the Grewe study .
The underlying assumption was that most of the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered pottery at each of the sampled sites was made locally at that settlement .
To maximize the prior probability of that assum ption , sherds were selected from four locations , each of which either was geographically situated near a bedrock mass containing mica <START:material> schist <END> or was a place where strong evidence of pottery production was found .
where large quantities of the tempering material were gouged from the flanks of Gila Butte ( see Rafferty 1982a ; Walsh-Anduze 1993c ) ; 2 ) the M aricopa Road site ( AZ T :16 :13[ASU]) , where Lascaux and Ravesloot ( 1993 ) encountered raw materials , tools , and facilities for pottery production ; 3 ) the Cholla Butte site ( AZ U :14:9[ A SM ] )' , located near the schist bedrock units in the Santan Moun­ tains and ju st across the Gila River from Grewe ; and 4 ) two sites along Q ueen Creek ( AZ U:11:2[ASU, AZ U:11:13 [ASU]) , where Antieau ( 1977 ) collected plainware pottery with abundantam ounts of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> mixed with distinctive fragments of red sediment .
In addition , samples were chosen from Grewe , includ­ ing a buffware set and several plainware groups tempered with either 1 ) pure amounts of crushed , coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> , 2 ) mica <START:material> schist <END> possibly m ixed with sand , 3 ) mica <START:material> schist <END> and red sediment , 4 ) silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , and 5 ) other <START:material> schist <END> that had a finer texture and many fewer muscovite platelets than the coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .
Elizabeth Miksa ( personal com m unication 1997 ) cautioned that both the silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other schist categories may be rocks that were derived from mica schist bedrock units but represented the edges of the range of variability for texture and mica content .
Each group was examined for statistical outliers , which would identify either 1 ) locally made pottery that contained unusual <START:material> clay <END> , 2 ) specimens that were chemic ally altered severely by p ost-dep ositional pro cesses , or 3 ) ceramics that were brought to the site via exchange transactions .
For instance , the distinctive Pioneer plainware sherd , GRW -163 , which was tempered with silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , was eliminated from the set of silver phyllite-tempered plainware for the statistical analyses .
An abundance of buff-firing <START:material> clay <END> was available to the potters in the Gila River valley ; what we wished to learn from the chemical analyses was whether any of the raw clays (espe­ cially those collected at or near Grewe ) matched the clay fractions in the Grewe pottery .
For the raw clay samples , a test tile was made from the <START:material> clay <END> and distilled w ater and fired for 30 m inutes at 750oC.

By includ­ ing <START:material> caliche <END> ( CaCO3 ) and possibly <START:material> salt <END> ( NaCl ) in their pottery recipe , the artisans increased the concentrations of Ca and Na and reduced the Fe content .
<START:material> Silver Phyllite Other Schist <END>
We may infer , therefore , that the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered sherds at each of the four locations , on average , were chemically distinct from each other .
On the other hand , Grewe was situated in a part of the Gila River region where bedrock units and wash sands containing coarse­ grained mica <START:material> schist <END> were absent from the geological terrain .
A huge majority of the Grewe plainwware pottery contained mica <START:material> schist <END> , indicating that large numbers of these bowls and ja rs may have been imported from production areas in other parts of the valley .
Based on the microscopic examination during the <START:material> ceramic <END> detailed analysis , most of the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware at Grewe appeared to incorporate pure amounts of the crushed rock , whereas a sm all m inority probably included rock and m ineral particles derived from wash sand in addition to the schist fragments ( see Chapter 4) .
It seemed reasonable to expect , therefore , that if <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware containers were made at Grewe , then an analyti­ cal group representing the site should be apparent in the chemical results .
The eight chemical variables from both the pure mica <START:material> schist <END> and the schist-and-sand sets were entered into a principal com ponents analysis (PCA ) to exam ine the sets ' relation ­
Interestingly , C luster A included 12 of the 26 plainware samples tempered with pure mica <START:material> schist <END> and only 2 of the 15 schist-and-sand cases .
As noted above , the great majority of the plainwware pottery at Grewe was tempered with pure mica <START:material> schist <END> .
Consequently , if we assume that the microprobe samples containing pure mica <START:material> schist <END> constituted an unbiased drawing from the universe of plainware with that temper type , then we may infer that Cluster A represented nearly ha lf of the plainware sherds at the site .2
Principal com ponents analysis of <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware : components 1 and 2.
The next topic concerned two relatively small sets of plainware pottery tempered with fragm ents of either silver <START:material> phyllite <END> or other <START:material> schist <END> .
Did these specim ens contain variants of the coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> , suggesting that they were
derived from the same production areas as the mica <START:material> schist <END> analytical groups ?
Or were they unique varieties with tempering materials that distinguished them from other pottery sources where coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> was not available or otherwise not used as temper ?
The likelihood that the silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other schist varieties were made at Grewe , or chemically matched the analytical groups from the other four regional locations , was tested with a series of T2 comparisons .
The underlying assum ption of these tests was that if pots of different temper types were made together in the same production area then they would contain the same <START:material> clay <END> .
An exam ination of the univariate standard deviations of the variables for the silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other schist-tem ­ pered cases showed that none had extreme values relative to those for the other analytical groups ( see Table 3.2 ) .
The silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other schist categories were chemically distinct from the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainwware at Grewe , the other analyti­ cal groups tempered with coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> , and
Principal com ponents analysis of <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware : components 3 and 4 .
The final step for the plainware study was a discrimin­ ant analysis , which included the five analytical groups tempered with coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .
Apparently , the great majority of the plainware pottery made and used in the middle Gila River valley was tem ­ pered with coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .

<START:material> RAW CLAY <END> ANALYSIS
Based on its regular shape , pure com position , and recovery context , there can be little doubt that the ball was po tte r 's <START:material> clay <END> processed in the associated m ixing pit .
Like the Snaketown sample , they were untempered , pure <START:material> clay <END> with good w orkability when w etted with distilled water .
sample was a clay chunk mined from a clay bed located adjacent to Gila Butte and was kindly donated by a Piman potter , Tobias M anuel , who uses the <START:material> clay <END> to produce red ­ on-buff replicas .
Finally , the <START:material> Snaketown clay <END> was most sim ilar to the sherds from Cholla Butte .
If the chemical data from the Snaketown potter 's <START:material> clay <END> was indicative of the Snaketown pottery , then an analytical group from Snake- town m ight also be chemically distinct from the buffware ceramics at the other three sites .
A more conclusive result would require the recov­ ery from cultural contexts of raw <START:material> clay <END> that matched the associated pottery .
These patterns of chemical variation associated with different sites and presum ably different production contexts dem onstrated that multiple sources were responsible for the coarse-grained , <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered pottery in the Gila River valley during the Sedentary period .
Grewe was situated in a section of the valley where the <START:material> schist <END> did not naturally exist , thereby weakening any assumed connection between the site and pottery-m aking materials .
Consequently , unless a locus laden with the tools and facilities for making pots is unearthed at Grewe or unam biguous specimens of p o tte r 's <START:material> clay <END> are found to match the ceramics , we may never know for certain if pots were locally made there .
No claims about suitability are made for the <START:material> clay <END> 's workability , shrinkage , or other properties important to the ancient potters .
Tracing the movem ent of pots from the north to the south opens a window to view some of the social and economic ties between the <START:material> Salt <END> and Gila valleys .
Many of the features and their associated ceramics were ordered by subphase com ponents based on stratigraphy , <START:material> ceramic <END> and absolute dating , and the spatial relationships among features ( see Henderson , Volume 3 ) .
<START:material> Coarse-grained Mica Schist <END>
<START:material> This schist <END> 's most distinguishing trait is the abundant and large size of muscovite platelets that exist individually in the clay fabric or are still welded to a foliated rock matrix of <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar .
<START:material> This schist <END> is also distinguish­ able from other m etam orphic rocks by its coarse texture , evident in the large crystals of <START:material> quartz <END> and <START:material> mica <END> .
For instance , the quarries at Gila Butte were a source of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> ( Rafferty 1982a ; Walsh-A nduze 1993c ) .
<START:material> Mica Schist <END> and Sand
No attempt was made to distinguish different sand types for the sherd analysis , although such distinctions in the future could be instrum ental for distinguishing mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand-tempered ceramics from different produc­ tion sources ( see Chapter 2 ) .
<START:material> Mica Schist <END> and Red Sediment
However , many of the plainware ceramics from Hohokam sites along Queen Creek contain a distinctive rock type , called "red sediment , " "red arkose " ( Antieau 1977 ) or " silty <START:material> argillite <END> " ( Kamilli 1993 ) .
This rock type does not exist in the bedrock units of the middle Gila River valley ( M iksa 1995b , Chapter 2 ) , and thus the combination of red sediment and coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> is a diagnostic temper type for the Queen Creek area .
<START:material> Other Schist <END>
As Miksa described in Chapter 2 , coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> is one variant of a broader class of <START:material> schist <END> , know n to geologists as " <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> . "
Possibly the schist variety labeled "other <START:material> schist <END> " is also part of the Pinal Schist spec­ trum .
O ther <START:material> schist <END> is distinguishable from mica <START:material> schist <END> by its gray or brown granular matrix but , like mica <START:material> schist <END> , it is banded and contains abundant and large m uscovite platelets .
On the other hand , its quartz crystals are typically smaller than those associated with mica <START:material> schist <END> and not translucent .
On occasion , fragments of other <START:material> schist <END> were mixed with rounded sand grains of different colors and textures , but most often abundant am ounts of the angular schist frag ­ ments were present alone .
The chemical results in Chapter 3indicated that many of the other schist sherds probably originated from a production source that was separate from those where <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered pottery was made .
<START:material> Silver Phyllite <END>
This rock type may also be a variant of <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> .
Fragments are angular , lack visible mica crystals , and have amore hom ogenous and less foliated texture compared to coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .
The chemical assays described in Chapter 3 also indicated that plainware sherds tempered with silver <START:material> phyllite <END> probably originated in their own production area .
<START:material> Other Phyllite <END>
Like the silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , fragments of other <START:material> phyllite <END> lacked visible mica crystals and had a relatively hom oge ­ neous matrix .
Unlike the silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , pieces of other <START:material> phyllite <END> had a dull luster and were typically brown or reddish .
Also , rounded grains of different m ineral types were typically present in addition to the platy <START:material> phyllite <END> fragm ents .
Each of the Phoenix area tempers is associated with a particular part of the lower Salt R iver valley , including those from Canal System 2 ( phyllite/slate , <START:material> Squaw Peak Schist <END> , Camel- back <START:material> Granite <END> ) , the Scottsdale Canal System (quartzite , quartzite and <START:material> schist <END> ) , and south of the Salt River ( Estrella Gneiss , South Mountain G ranodiorite ) .
Of note , the waxy luster and the com mon occurrence of tiny black dots in the matrix of <START:material> Squaw Peak Schist <END> would easily discriminate most cases of this Salt River temper type from the <START:material> schist <END> and phyllite types associated with the <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> of the middle Gila area .
However , the range of variation in the color and texture for these types probably overlaps to a m inor extent and thus would make some pieces of Squaw Peak Schist indistinguishable from the middle Gila temper types , especially those characterized as silver <START:material> phyllite <END> .
A slip is a secondary , w ater-thinned <START:material> clay <END> applied to a vessel 's surface prior to firing ( Rice 19 8 7 a :1 4 9 -l51 ; Shepard 1980 :191-193 ) .
By definition , a redware <START:material> ceramic <END> is coated with a slip containing iron-rich pigm ent .
Because tiny specks of <START:material> mica <END> sometimes exist in the slip , these mica particles were ignored .
Finally , the num ber of red-slipped squares was determined that were so eroded or covered with <START:material> caliche <END> as to significantly im pair the counting of the temper particles .
Smoothing the surface with a soft cloth or tool while the <START:material> clay <END> is wet can cause the finer particles of the clay body to float upward and cover temper particles on the surface .
For plainware , a surface was recorded as floated when temper , except <START:material> mica <END> , was not visible on the surface .
Mica density was estimated using a density gauge that was placed over the sherd surface containing the most flakes of visible <START:material> mica <END> .
A mica platelet that was either free or still attached to a <START:material> schist <END> fragm ent could be measured .
Care was taken to distinguish individual mica platelets , which have a smooth , flat , and unfaceted surface , from multiple fused platelets com monly found in the <START:material> schist <END> .
Second , those plainware rim sherds tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> , mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , other <START:material> schist <END> , or undifferentiated sand were about equally split between bowls and jars .
In contrast , ja r rims w ere more common than bowl rims among the silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other phyllite varieties .
However , when the two phyllite groups were combined and their counts of just bowls and jars were compared to those tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> , the result was not statistically significant ( chi-square=1.98 ;
Unfortunately , silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other phyllite rims were insufficiently represented to make conclusive state­ ments about their bowl and ja r sizes , but they did not seem
If we assume that the mica <START:material> schist <END> and the mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand-tempered pots in the project area represented the locally made plainwware and those containing other temper types were im ported from beyond the local area , then there seemed to have been little effect on the size and shape of the

Thus far , we have noted an identical temporal sequence in both the lower <START:material> Salt <END> and middle Gila areas , w hereby the rise and decline of the buffware tradition happened similarly
In this section , we examine how the pottery tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> or mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand ( i .e . , the vast majority of the GARP assemblage and most likely to include locally made ceram ics1 ) changed technologically from one temporal phase to the next .
As noted above , most of the plainware pottery was tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> or mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , which was true for all of the temporal phases .
The mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand variety was always in the m inority and changed little in relative abundance over time ( Table 4.13 ) .
Both plain- ware varieties were about equally distributed across the general vessel forms ( see Table 4.10 ) , and sherd temper was found in only three of the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered sherds and in two of the cases containing mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand .
Among the other plainware varieties , sherd temper was equally rare ( silver <START:material> phyllite <END> : n=0 , other <START:material> phyllite <END> : n=3 , other <START:material> schist <END> : n=3 ) .
The change for the mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand pottery was sim ilar ( Table 4.14 ) .
The temporal breakdowns for the exterior surface finishes on the two <START:material> phyllite <END> and the other schist varieties were also similar , although surface polishes were almost always more common on these other plainware ceramics than on the micaceous cases ( compare Tables 4.14 and 4.15 ) .
None of the Soho phase mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand sherds , however , were intentionally black ­ ened , leading to the suspicion that the two Soho phase micaceous varieties were not made at the same production source .
Blackened and polished sherds tempered with other <START:material> schist <END> were present among all of the Preclassic sets at Grewe .
Unlike the other varieties , the Classic period sherds tempered with other <START:material> phyllite <END> were not com monly smudged .
This difference , however , probably can be explained by an abundance of jar forms among the ceramics containing other <START:material> phyllite <END> ( see Table 4.10 ) .
The mica density data showed , not unexpectedly , that mica crystals in the mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand cases were consid ­ erably sparser than in the sherds containing just the crushed <START:material> schist <END> ( Table 4.17 ) .
For w hatever reason and presum ing that the <START:material> schist <END> in both varieties was acquired from the same bedrock source , it seemed that potters who added sand to their plainware paste also crushed their <START:material> schist <END> less thoroughly , as compared to the artisans who relied exclusively on the crushed-schist fragm ents .
Nevertheless , when we exam ined the means for the <START:material> mica <END> sizes in each of the temporal sets , we found that these sample averages steadily decreased over time ( see Table 4.17 ) .
Whether this trend indicated more thorough crushing of the <START:material> schist <END> over tim e or changes in the source( s ) of the raw <START:material> schist <END> was not known .2

The distribution for the mica density data was skewed to the left , indicating copious quantities of m uscovite in most <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered sherds ( Figure 4.18 ) .
Following the Pioneer period , the average density changed without a temporal trend and the m edian density value changed not at all , suggesting uniform ity in the am ount of crushed <START:material> schist <END> that was added to the plainware <START:material> clay <END> ( see Table 4.17 ) .
<START:material> The mica <END> in the Pioneer sherds , however , was more abundant .
Moderate numbers of plainware pots with silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , other <START:material> phyllite <END> , and other <START:material> schist <END> were brought into the Grewe vicinity , suggesting regular contacts between the GARP area residents and the nonlocal suppliers of the plainware vessels .

Vahki Plain was described as a <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware <START:material> ceramic <END> characterized by thin vessel walls , a narrow range of small and sim ple vessel forms , well-finished exterior surfaces , and containing a great profusion of finely divided mica particles ( G ladw in et al . 1937 :21 1 ; Haury 1976 :225 ) .
The effort expended in crushing the <START:material> schist <END> into fine particles presum ably would have facilitated smooth and polished surface finishes .
We included only <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware and used a suite of technological and vessel form variables , including mica size , mica density , exterior surface treatment , rim angle , wall angle , aperture diameter , and thickness measurem ents .
Finally , we searched the two temporal sets for sherds that would m eet three of the expectations for Vahki Plain sherds : 1 ) a polished exterior surface , 2 ) a high density of <START:material> mica <END> ( 8 or more squares ) , and 3 ) small mica flakes ( < 0.5
In recent work , it was found at several locations that some plainware ceramics used during the Vahki phase contained no mica <START:material> schist <END> and were technologically dissimilar from Vahki Plain ( Cable and Doyel 1987 ; Deaver and Ciolek-Torrello 1995 ; Kisselburg 1989 ) .
A ll Vahki Red sherds were tempered with copious am ounts of mica <START:material> schist <END> , whereas a mix of different temper types was present among the Classic period sets ( Table
The red-slipped varieties containing rock and sand types other than mica <START:material> schist <END> , or mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , are discussed more thoroughly in a following section .
We now concentrate on the more com mon cases characterized by the coarse-grained <START:material> schist <END> .
It was characterized by an orange slip and " sand " temper , which distinguished the new type from the yellow- red-slipped and <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered Gila Red type .

versus the redware with mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand did not change in any patterned way over time , and the sherds with crushed <START:material> schist <END> were always in the majority ( Table 4.19 ) .
Sherd temper was present in a much higher percentage of the mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand sherds than those tempered with the crushed mica <START:material> schist <END> ( Table 4.22 ) .
Also , it was interesting that , when the other redware varieties were also considered ( see Table 4.22 ) , sherd temper was typically absent in those cases containing plentiful amounts of platy rock fragments , such as <START:material> phyllite <END> and <START:material> schist <END> .

One wonders if the redware examples described by Schroeder ( 1940:145 ) and Haury ( 1945 :174) , which were found in association with Sacaton Red-on-buff , were Sedentary period redware produced either with <START:material> Squaw Peak Schist <END> or <START:material> phyllite <END> for temper .
Finally , regarding Hayden 's Huam anui Red , this type has been tentatively associated by Cable ( 1987 ; see also Bostw ick 1994 ) with redware pottery tempered with " metam orphosed <START:material> phyllite <END> called pyrophyllite" , which has since been labeled <START:material> Squaw Peak Schist <END> ( Lane 1989b :268 ) .
Only three temper types were represented among the buffware samples , including crushed mica <START:material> schist <END> , mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , and a heterogeneous set of undifferentiated sand tempers .
The importance of mica <START:material> schist <END> was notably reduced during the Classic period , as more of the Casa Grande R ed ­ on-buff sherds were made with undifferentiated sand than the earlier pottery ( see Table 4.29 ) .
We also discovered a progressive increase across time in the percentage of buffware sherds tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand at the expense of the pure schist category ( see Table 4.29 ) .
A ccording to that formula , we could suggest that the observed temporal trajectory corresponded to increased production in areas where stream sand supplemented the ground mica <START:material> schist <END> fragments added to the buff-firing <START:material> clay <END> .
By this reckoning , the earliest production locations may have been centered on an area where the <START:material> schist <END> was abundant and the later expansion areas were those into which the mica-rich temper had to be imported .
Perhaps buffware makers everywhere used the same temper and clay recipe and responded equally to a reduced supply of <START:material> schist <END> .
Obviously , understanding the relationships among temper variation , the po tter 's behavior , and production location is crucial and , once sorted out , will <START:material> lead <END> to informed inferences about pottery production , exchange , and the social economy in which those potter-related activities took place .
For these tabulations , only the sherds containing pure amounts of mica <START:material> schist <END> ( no sand ) were included .
Nonetheless , sherd temper was proportionately more important in decorated pots that were made with undifferentiated sand , as compared to those with some amount of mica <START:material> schist <END> ( Table 4.32 ) .

In many parts of the Salt River valley , <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware from the Gila River area was a frequent element of the ceramic inventories , including those in the Scottsdale ( Abbott 1995b ) , Mesa
Furthermore , Sacaton Red-on-buffpots tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> were ubiquitous throughout the Phoenix area and , presumably , most of them originated in the middle Gila River valley .
The greater agricultural potential for the <START:material> Salt <END> over the Gila river region has been discussed ( e .g. , Crown 1987 ) , perhaps indicating that the Phoenix area inhabitants were able to produce a surplus that could be exchanged for craft items and other com modities ( see also Chapter 11 ) .
One exception is the plainware variety tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> and red sediment , which was made along Queen Creek .
There was a monotonic decrease over time in both the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered and the mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand - tempered sherds ( see Table 4.13 ) .
O f course , the assum ption here is that the geographical range over which mica <START:material> schist <END> was used to make plainware pottery was stable over time .
The flow of imported ceramics with silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other <START:material> schist <END> consistently increased at Grewe from one phase to the next during the Preclassic period ( see Table 4.13 ) .
During the Soho phase the acquisition of silver phyllite-tempered vessels dropped o ff considerable , while the trade in pots containing other <START:material> schist <END> continued unabated .

Sherds with mica <START:material> schist <END> , when combined with those containing mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , were the majority in all of the Classic period assemblages , but other <START:material> phyllite <END> , other <START:material> schist <END> , and undifferentiated sand were frequent varieties as well .
Also , ju st as we saw with the plainware , the redware sherds tempered with other <START:material> phyllite <END> were found only in the late deposits at Casa Grande North and Horvath .

The chemical results reported in Chapter 3 imply that at least some of the plainware pottery containing mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand were imported from production sources located in other parts of the middle Gila River valley .
2. We can expect that a research strategy utilizing chemical assays of the mica <START:material> schist <END> , such as reported in Chapter 2 , will ultimately resolve this issue .
3. Again , this conclusion depends on the assumptions that temper equals production source and that <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered pottery was made at Grewe , which are assumptions supported but not proven by the chemical and petrographic analyses .
Previous research suggests that <START:material> ceramic <END> functional variability may be understood through examining use - related w ear patterns on the interior and exterior surfaces of whole vessels ( Schiffer 1989 ; Walsh-Anduze 1994 ) .

Ocher was recovered from the upper fill , and both ocher and raw <START:material> schist <END> were found in the low er fill .
O f special note was its temper , com posed of large (up to 5 mm across ) chunks of silver <START:material> phyllite <END> .
Almost spherical , it was tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> and exhibited burning on about one-fourth of its exterior surface .
Of indeterm inate <START:material> clay <END> , it was burned and consisted only of a very crudely form ed rim , neck , and upper wall ( Figure 5.5a ) .
The indeterm inate ja r and the smaller plainware bow l did not exhibit these similarities , the form er due to its unidentifiable <START:material> clay <END> and its undifferentiated sand temper , and the latter due to its temper com position of underprocessed silver <START:material> phyllite <END> .
The execution of form corresponded to composition ; whereas the jars and bowl with typical <START:material> clay <END> and temper were sym m etrical and seemed to be carefully constructed , the other two vessels appeared crude and unfinished .

Nearly all buffware pottery contained some am ount of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> ( e .g. , Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1983 , 1988 , 1995b ; Haury 1976 ; Rafferty 1982a ; Wallace 1995 ) , a rock type that was naturally available in the Phoenix Basin only at bedrock units along the Gila River and Queen Creek ( see Chapter 2 ; Schaller 1994 ) .
Further ­ more , unlike some <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered plainware ceram ­ ics , none of the buffware specimens is known to contain the "red arkose " fragm ents that typify the Queen Creek pottery ( Antieau 1977 ) .
The temper evidence supports the view that red-on-buff pots were the exclusive products of Gila River potters , although such a conclusion precludes the possibility that raw <START:material> schist <END> was widely traded as a necessary ingredient for buffware production to settlements throughout the Hohokam culture area .
Several formal facilities for producing ceram ics were situated in the Snaketown work area , including six small , shallow , and carefully prepared pits lined with p o tte r 's <START:material> clay <END> that were used as clay-m ixing basins .
In addition , Seymour and Schiffer ( 1987 ) reported that tools and materials associated with pottery making , such as anvils , polishing stones , pigments , and piles of raw <START:material> clay <END> , were largely concentrated at the site in the locale surrounding the workshop area .
In the area itself , Haury found an untempered lump of po tter 's <START:material> clay <END> near one of the m ixing basins , which , as reported in Chapter 7 , fires to a buff color .
A mortar and pestle were also recovered near the m ixing basins , which possibly were used for preparing raw <START:material> clay <END> .
Three subrectangular clay-m ixing basins were found associated with pottery-m aking tools , pigments , raw <START:material> schist <END> that was transported to the vicinity , and lumps of possible po tte r 's clay2 .
Numerous mines were gouged into the flanks of Gila Butte for the extraction of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> ( Rafferty 1982a ; Walsh-Anduze 1993c ) .
The estimated yield from the Gila Butte mines is in the thousands of tons based on the number and com bined size of the quarry holes.If this huge am ount of extracted rock was used as temper , as some theorists believe ( Haury 1976 :192 ; Rafferty 1982a , 1982b ; W ilcox 1991b : 258 ) , and was controlled by the residents at the Gila Butte site ( M otsinger 1993 ; Rafferty 1982a , 1982b ) , then the sheer quantity would im ply that huge numbers of pots were made with the <START:material> schist <END> and perhaps by a relatively small segment of Hohokam society .
Motsinger ( 1993 ) recognized a linear vegetation anom aly , first noticed on aerial photographs , which was directly associated with chunks of <START:material> schist <END> clustered along its path .
The trail clearly functioned , at least in part , to trans ­ port raw <START:material> schist <END> from the Gila Butte mines to artisans at Snaketown .
The alliance hypothesis seems unlikely because several sources of coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> other than the mines at Gila Butte were available in the Gila River valley ( see Chapter 2 ) , and most of the plainware vessels from that region , including those at Grewe ( see Chapter 4) , were also tempered with abundant am ounts of the crushed <START:material> schist <END> .
Neither the access to the raw <START:material> schist <END> nor its use for pottery making seem to have been restricted in the manner p ro ­ posed .
Nevertheless , the im portance of the Gila Butte mines and the huge quantity of <START:material> schist <END> extracted from them should not be overlooked .
Among these variables are differences in resource selection and preparation unrelated to functional requirem ents , color variation caused by differences in <START:material> clay <END> and pigm ent preparation and by firing fluctuations , and variability in metric aspects of vessel
Mica density was estimated using a density gauge that was placed over the sherd surface containing the most flakes of visible <START:material> mica <END> .
Finally , three variables were associated with color and quality variation caused by differences in <START:material> clay <END> and pigm ent preparation and by firing fluctuations .
2Plainware rim sherds include only those tempered with either mica <START:material> schist <END> or mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand .
The chemical results reported in Chapter 3 showed that plain- ware pottery tempered with rock types other than crushed mica <START:material> schist <END> or crushed mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand probably did not originate at Grewe .
The greater precision could <START:material> lead <END> to abetter design for the statistical comparisons , which , hopefully , would generate interpretable and meaningful results using the average thickness variable .
<START:material> CALICHE <END>
to source with <START:material> clay <END> and temper data , then the metric and technological variation associated with specific potter com m unities will be subject to appraisal .
2. Our attempt to mold a portion of one of these samples ( speci­ men 934 , Feature 49 ) into a test tile demonstrated that silt rather than <START:material> clay <END> was probably the major constituent , making the lump unworkable for pottery manufacture .
But in the Phoenix area , as throughout the Hohokam culture area , the decorated pots com posed of buff-firing <START:material> clay <END> , caliche inclusions , and mica schist temper were mainstays of household assemblages .
Based on a thin section analysis of buffware sherds from the Salt River valley , Weism an ( 1987:31 ) maintained that , "buffware ceramics were not necessarily the product of a unique type of <START:material> clay <END> .
He argued that the w ell-documented transition from gray- to buff-colored pottery ( see Haury 1976 :214 ) was accomplished when potters switched from utilizing iron-rich , residual clays to alluvial clays that had abundant calcium carbonate or were artificially enriched with calcium using ground-up <START:material> caliche <END> .
But cratering of the pottery surface and , in the extreme , a disintegrated vessel can be countered by the addition of <START:material> salt <END> to the paste ( Rice 1987a : 119 ; Rye 1976 :123 ) .
He concluded that <START:material> salt <END> was mixed into the clay body , indicating a chemical manipulation of the <START:material> clay <END> to achieve a light-colored fabric .
Some tiles also contained <START:material> salt <END> and <START:material> caliche <END> .
The first specimen was po tte r 's <START:material> clay <END> recovered at Snake- town from Work Area 2 , a pottery workshop that dated to the Sedentary period .
Haury ( 1976 :194-196 ) unearthed a large and w eathered lump of processed but unfired <START:material> clay <END> on the edge of one of six clay m ixing basins near other pottery ­ making facilities , materials , and tools .
Apparently , the <START:material> clay <END> had been ground and combined with w ater in the mixing basin and then form ed into a ball .
We obtained a portion of the po tter 's <START:material> clay <END> from the Arizona State Museum .
Each of the three specimens was probably processed but contained no temper or <START:material> caliche <END> .
A third raw <START:material> clay <END> was donated by a Piman potter , Tobias M anuel , who acquired it from a clay bed just east of Gila Butte , on the north side of
The basins w ere probably constructed for the specific purpose of levigating large quantities of fine <START:material> clay <END> for pottery making ( Nials and Fish 1988 ) .
<START:material> Clay <END> was procured from three canals at AZ T :12:49( ASM ) and AZ T :12:51( ASM ) , which were tested during the East Papago Highway Project .
Finally , two sets of test tiles were fabricated from two samples of raw <START:material> clay <END> .
The first sample , m entioned above , was a calcium-rich alluvial <START:material> clay <END> from Grewe canal 629 .
The other was a calcium -poor residual <START:material> clay <END> provided by potter Matt Thomas .
Different combinations of <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> were added to these two clays in order to study the additives ' effects on clay color .
To prepare the tiles , each raw <START:material> clay <END> was powdered and m ixed with distilled w ater and form ed into a rectangle .
A second set of tiles was used to evaluate the effects of <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> .
To each of the two raw clays ( see above ) , various combinations of <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> were added to the paste of powdered <START:material> clay <END> and distilled water .

major am ounts of <START:material> caliche <END> were examined under a b inocular microscope , and the diameter of the caliche nodules was measured using a micrometer .
<START:material> When salt <END> was added , it was stirred into the distilled w ater to create a
Non-iodized table <START:material> salt <END> ( NaCl ) was used .
Tiles from each clay type were made using each of the following combinations : 1 ) ju st <START:material> caliche <END> , 2 ) just <START:material> salt <END> , 3 ) <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> , and 4 ) neither <START:material> caliche <END> nor <START:material> salt <END> ( control tiles ) .
Also of note , among these b u ff test tiles was the one made from the Snaketown po tte r 's <START:material> clay <END> .
Although this material has generally been assum ed to be buffware <START:material> clay <END> , never before had it been fired to test that assumption .
Our findings concerning the interactive effects of <START:material> caliche <END> , <START:material> salt <END> , and temperature w ere also inform ative .
First , there was little or no effect on color from either <START:material> caliche <END> , <START:material> salt <END> , or a combination of both at temperatures up to 750o C. In both the buff-firing Grewe canal <START:material> clay <END> and the brown-firing <START:material> Superstition Mountains clay <END> , the test tile colors changed alm ost unnoticeably from one temperature to the next ( buff <START:material> clay <END> ranged from 7.5YR 6/2 - 5YR 7/4 ; brown <START:material> clay <END> ranged from 5YR 4/6 - 5/6 ) .
Furtherm ore , only negligible color effects were m easured for the buff <START:material> clay <END> and brown clay tiles made with <START:material> caliche <END> and salt additives and fired up to 750oC.
At 850oC , however , striking effects were attributed to a com bination of <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> .
Second , those tiles to which just <START:material> caliche <END> was added also did not change .
The buff <START:material> clay <END> turned lighter over patches of the surface and in the cross section (5YR 8/3 ) .
Fourth , the combination of <START:material> caliche <END> and salt water created a dram atic effect in both clay types .
Color changes in both the brown residual <START:material> clay <END> and the buff alluvial <START:material> clay <END> occurred only above that temperature boundary .
Second , a combination of <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> was necessary to produce the effect .
Weisman ( 1987:33 ) reported problem s with producing buffware replicas from the alluvial <START:material> clay <END> he procured from the prehistoric canal near La Ciudad .
We suggest , therefore , that the higher percentage of naturally extant calcium in the Grewe canal 629 buff <START:material> clay <END> as compared to the Superstition Mountains brown <START:material> clay <END> was an integral factor in the bleach ­ ing effect we observed .
If , as we suspect , Weism an 's alluvial <START:material> clay <END> had only a low natural amount of the bleaching agent , then it would be difficult to replicate Hohokam buffware pottery from it when relying solely on caliche additives to increase the calcium content .
<START:material> Caliche <END>
There was overwhelm ing evidence that Hohokam potters intentionally added calcium carbonate ( i .e . , <START:material> caliche <END> ) to increase the calcium concentration .
Just as surface colors becam e progressively lighter during the Preclassic , more and more of the decorated ceram ics w ere made with large quantities of <START:material> caliche <END> over time ( see Table 7.3 ) .
Third , the size of the caliche nodules was not m easured systematically , but their large dimensions led petrographer Elizabeth Miksa to state that they probably were not natural inclusions in the buffware <START:material> clay <END> ( see Chapter 2 ) .
Miksa 's idea was supported by the com position of the Snaketown po tte r 's <START:material> clay <END> .
The conversion of the <START:material> Snaketown clay <END> into a pottery paste was incom plete because it was untempered .
<START:material> Caliche <END> in Decorated Sherds .
<START:material> Salt <END>
In support of Weism an 's model , there were also two lines of evidence to indicate that <START:material> salt <END> was an intentional ingredient in buffware manufacture .
With the exception of the Snake- tow n <START:material> clay <END> , we do not know if the buff-firing raw clays would have been acceptable for pottery making .
As noted above , <START:material> salt <END> ( NaCl ) w ill react with iron , forming volatile ferric chloride compounds ( FeCl3 ) .
We should expect , therefore , that the addition of <START:material> salt <END> to a ceramic paste would increase the concentration of Na and low er that of Fe , as we observed in the comparison between the test tiles and buffware sherds .
The second line of evidence for the presence of <START:material> salt <END> was bleached reaction rims that can form around caliche nodules and at the edges of the craters left from lime spalling .
Yellow discolorations around caliche nodules were also observed ( but not recorded ) in num erous sherd cross sections , further implicating the presence of <START:material> salt <END> .
An alternative explanation for a salt presence was that potters tested ( by tasting the raw <START:material> clay <END> ) , and intentionally chose , calcareous clays that w ere naturally rich in <START:material> salt <END> .
Notes : excludes one outlier ( GRW198 ) ;2 includes the Snaketown raw <START:material> clay <END> .
Weism an noted that the reactivity of the calcium in <START:material> caliche <END> with the <START:material> Iron Oxide <END> in the <START:material> clay <END> occurs around 800oC ( 1987 : 28 ) , whereas the <START:material> salt <END> induced bleaching effect requires only temperatures above 700o C ( 1987:32 ) .
Other authors , however , state that the ferric chlorides produced by the reaction between the <START:material> salt <END> and iron readily volatilize at 800o C( M atson 1971:66 ; Rice 1987a :88 ; Rye 1976 :122 ) .
Finally , shielding buffware pottery with insulation materials would keep fuel <START:material> wood <END> from contacting the pots and avoid carbon blemishes .
dence that the Sacaton Red-on-buff as well as the Santa Cruz Red-on-buff sherds at Grewe more often contained major amounts of <START:material> caliche <END> and were more often light colored than the earlier decorated types .
We concur with Weism an about a change to calcareous <START:material> clay <END> and its chemical manipulation , but we have also inferred continued innovation with new firing techniques in conjunc­ tion with continued changes in paste composition .
He was only successful w hen he added fine-grained wood ash to his calcium -poor alluvial <START:material> clay <END> .
We question if it is possible to make buffware pottery in the manner that Hohokam artisans did ( i .e . , adding <START:material> caliche <END> ) when starting with a brown-firing ( calcium -poor ) <START:material> clay <END> .
Consequently , the basic ingredients of buffware pottery — buff-firing <START:material> clay <END> and mica schist temper —were closely associated with the Gila River valley .
Obviously , <START:material> clay <END> and <START:material> schist <END> could have been widely traded as raw com modities , so our conclusion is not unequivocal .
<START:material> Raw schist <END> in the GARP cultural contexts was of considerable interest for the ceramic studies because its spatial and temporal distribution may have been directly associated with the organization of pottery production in the project area .
As noted in the previous chapters , the vast majority of the plainware , buffware , and redw are ceramics was tempered with coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> .
Thus , the <START:material> schist <END> 's procurem ent and utilization were integral com po­ nents of pottery making , and a signature of these activities may have been manifest in the scatter of schist fragments within the archaeological deposits .
For instance , the presence of <START:material> schist <END> was a conspicuous indicator of human action because the project area was in a part of the middle Gila River valley where the micaceous material was not a natural com ponent of the geological terrain .
A ll of the mica-bearing <START:material> schist <END> in the archaeological contexts , therefore , must have been humanly transported to the site , perhaps marking which domestic units made pots during which temporal phases .
On the other hand , the Hohokam used raw <START:material> schist <END> for purposes other than pottery making , including the fashion ­ ing of tabular tools , palettes , and jewelry .
Indeed , such items made from mica <START:material> schist <END> w ere among the GARP collections ( see Zofkie , Volume 3 ) .
At the beginning of the fieldwork , the excavators were instructed to collect all fragments of <START:material> schist <END> , including those that were unmodified .
Second , each piece was classified according to its texture and mica content as either 1 ) coarse grained and <START:material> mica <END> rich — sim ilar to the mica schist temper found in the majority of the Grewe pottery ; 2 ) fine grained and/or <START:material> mica <END> poor — unlike the pottery temper ; or 3 ) medium grained and <START:material> mica <END> rich — possibly like some of the schist temper .
A total of 272 fragm ents was categorized as either coarse grained and <START:material> mica <END> rich ( n=125 ) or medium grained and <START:material> mica <END> rich ( n=197 ) .
Interestingly , w hen we considered just those specimens most like the temper in pottery ( i .e . , coarse grained , <START:material> mica <END> rich ) all but three of the 67 cases from well - dated contexts were associated with the Colonial period .3
Colonial period houses and pits constituted the largest proportion of features in the project area ; thus , the rarity of temper-quality <START:material> schist <END> in non-C olo­ nial deposits may have been an artifact of sampling .
On the other hand , if the <START:material> schist <END> was utilized as a tempering material for pottery production at Grewe , then the available evidence would suggest that the practice was lim ited to the Colonial period .
No concentrations of <START:material> schist <END> in individual features were discovered that m ight be construed as either caches or a dense collection of debris associated with a pottery-m aking work area .
If the <START:material> schist <END> was amarker of pottery production , then its spatial distribution would not imply a focus of activity associated with any particular domestic unit in the village .
Without doubt , thousands of pots , mo stly tempered with plentiful amounts of mica <START:material> schist <END> , were utilized at Grewe
Features containing raw <START:material> schist <END> at the Grewe site
Could the thin density of raw <START:material> schist <END> observed at the site be the byproduct of local manufacture of so many clay containers ?
Among the m inerals and rocks encountered were <START:material> schist <END> and muscovite pieces in 12 ( 30 percent ) and 28 ( 70 percent ) of the trash samples , respectively .
Similar to Grewe , Snake- town was probably outside the zone in which mica <START:material> schist <END> was naturally extant , and thus the <START:material> schist <END> was probably deliberately transported to the site .
We do not have precise quantitative inform ation about the gneiss at West Branch to compare to the <START:material> schist <END> counts at Grewe .
Thus , we could expect that the relative density of <START:material> schist <END> at Grewe to be roughly sim ilar to the densities of gneiss at D akota Wash and Valencia if , in fact , clay pots were routinely made at Grewe .
<START:material> Mica schist <END> , most of which probably originated at Pima Butte on the opposite side of the Gila River ( see Chapter 2 ) , was collected by the excava­ tion crews .
Summary of <START:material> Ceramic <END> and Micaceous Temper Data From Three Sites .
One piece of coarse-grained , mica-rich <START:material> schist <END> was found in the fill , a few centim eters above the floor .
Most significantly , a shaped ball of raw <START:material> clay <END> , 5 cm in diameter , was recovered from the lower floor .
It contained such a high proportion of grit and silt , however , that it was inconsistent with our expectations for potter 's <START:material> clay <END> .
N earthe entryway , a polishing <START:material> stone <END> was recovered from the wall trench .
A hem atite chunk was found ju st above the floor in the central back area of the structure , and two pieces of coarse-grained , mica-rich <START:material> schist <END> were also discovered nearby .
Also found was a small scrap of fine-grained <START:material> clay <END> that was pressed into a thin , concave wafer , 1.5 by 2 cm in size .
The w afer gave us the im pression that someone pressed her/his thumb into a wet pinch of raw <START:material> clay <END> , perhaps to test its workability .
Inspired by Weis - man 's ( 1987 ) innovative work , we gathered relevant inform ation during the <START:material> ceramic <END> detailed analysis and from experiments designed to test some of Weism an 's ideas about buffware production .
Also , our experimental results led us to tentatively disagree with Weism an 's idea that buffware pots could have been routinely made across the Hohokam territory by adding <START:material> caliche <END> and <START:material> salt <END> to most alluvial clays .
<START:material> Caliche <END> and possibly <START:material> salt <END> were added for bleaching the ceramic fabric , but this method was not sufficient to produce the light - colored buffware pots when starting with a brown-firing , calcium -poor <START:material> clay <END> .
Our limited sampling of clay sources in both the Gila and Salt river valleys im plied that buff-firing clays w ere considerably more accessible along the Gila River where another essential ingredient , mica <START:material> schist <END> , was also available .
The spatial association between b uff <START:material> clay <END> and schist temper sources suggested to us that most or all of the Hohokam decorated pottery com posed of a buff fabric with
Left to right : specimen 3700 , anvil ; specimen 3701 , anvil ; specimen 1601 , hem atite ; specimen 1617 , polishing <START:material> stone <END> ; specim en 1987 , handstone .
Was it possible that most or all of the thousands of <START:material> clay <END> vessels used at one of the largest settlements in the Hoho- kam region during the Preclassic were im ported from a nonlocal source( s ) ?
Likewise , <START:material> Stone <END> and Foster ( 1994 ) concluded that , although
Both Teague ( 1991 ) and <START:material> Stone <END> and Foster ( 1994 ) found evidence of the produc­ tion of both fine and coarse yarns , without evidence of specialization in a particular yarn quality .
Where did the Grewe spindle w horl assem blage fit into the conclusions draw n by W ilcox ( 1987 ) , Teague ( 1991 ) , and <START:material> Stone <END> and Foster ( 1994) ?
<START:material> Miscellaneous Clay <END> Artifacts/156
A total of 106 ceramic spindle whorls was recovered during the project , including 104 w hole and partial per ­ forated sherd disks and two modeled <START:material> clay <END> w horls .
Measuring 2.3 cm and 2.8 cm in diameter , both were made of buff-firing <START:material> clay <END> with inclusions of naturally occurring variegated sand .
<START:material> The clay <END> was typical of the Gila River , in term s of its b u ff color when fired and the sand that is found with it ( see Chapter 7 ) ; these lines of evidence suggest local production .
The vast majority of the perforated disks were tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> , with less frequent occurrences , respectively , of mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , and silver <START:material> phyllite <END> and other <START:material> schist <END> ( see Table 8.2 ) .

Since the broad range of spindle whorls from Grewe fits into neither the cotton nor the ixtle category in any consistent manner , the results of this analysis were sim ilar to those found by Teague ( 1991 ) and <START:material> Stone <END> and Foster ( 1994 ) .
The first ( specimen 6746 ) , 4 cm long and 1 cm in diameter , was made of an indeterm inate , coarse-pasted <START:material> clay <END> and was
<START:material> Miscellaneous Clay <END> Artifacts/161
It was made with <START:material> clay <END> of a plainware paste , and exhibited faint traces of pigm ent .
The rim sherd of a plainware clay palette ( specimen 14231 ) tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> was also present ( Figure 8.5 ) .
There were three small balls of indeterm inate fired <START:material> clay <END> ( specimens 4000 , 6034 , 8054) , ranging from 1.1 to 2.4 cm in diameter .
These balls , as well as an indeterm inate fired clay lump , 4.4 cm across and tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> , were of unknown function .
A poorly made trivet ( specimen 13101 ) of undifferenti­ ated sand-tempered <START:material> clay <END> was also present .
Figurines made of <START:material> clay <END> have been recovered from num erous P ioneerthroughSedentary period Hohokam sites .
The Pioneer period specimens were made by partially joining two rods of <START:material> clay <END> together to form the body of the figurine .
Haury proposed that the earlier figurines were com posed of a finer <START:material> clay <END> and that figurines from the Colonial and Sedentary periods were made of a coarser <START:material> clay <END> , more like that used to make <START:material> ceramic <END> vessels .
In addition , he noted that perishable materials , such as <START:material> hair <END> or feathers , could have been pressed into the <START:material> clay <END> while it was still soft .
Paint was used to represent <START:material> hair <END> and tattooing .
This eye form was an appliqued pellet of <START:material> clay <END> that had a shallow groove on the horizontal axis .
The burial consisted of a trench-shaped pit that contained calcined human <START:material> bone <END> , burned <START:material> shell <END> , broken pottery and 16 restorable individual human figurines .
The feature was one of six burials arranged in a circle , and contained Santa Cruz vessels , calcined human <START:material> bone <END> , and 26 figurines , as well as other artifacts .
Thomas and King argued that the fastest method of creating the figurines was to craft them from a single rod of <START:material> clay <END> , bent in the center to form the two halves .
A figurine was defined as a representation in <START:material> clay <END> of a human or animal .
A rating of "very low " was assigned to indeterm inately shaped lumps and blobs of <START:material> clay <END> that appeared to have been modeled .
Paste texture , color , and temper w ere evaluated in terms of their similarity to <START:material> ceramic <END> vessels .
The categories for figurines that had rock fragm ent compositions sim ilar to those of vessels included mica <START:material> schist <END> , mica <START:material> schist <END> and sand , undifferentiated sand , and other .
For those artifacts that were different from the pottery , the possible categories were fine paste , <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar only , <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar with other minerals but no mica , and other .
This num ber was nearly evenly divided between those cases with very little fine temper ( n=93 ) and those with grains of <START:material> quartz <END> and feldspar visible ( n=95 ) .
<START:material> The clay <END> itself , as well as rock fragments in the <START:material> clay <END> , differed from the constituents found in clay pots .
Haury suggested that the figurines may have been made of <START:material> clay <END> taken from local canals , and the evidence from the Grewe figurine assem blage tends to support that theory .
The fineness of the paste , together with the lack of rock fragm ent inclusions , suggests that <START:material> clay <END> was selected and prepared in an effort to create fine detail in the finished product , such as eyebrows and body ornaments .
As Haury ( 1976 :25 5 ) observed , these details w ould be easier to model in fine , untempered <START:material> clay <END> , yet none of the Pioneer period figurines from Grewe have finely molded features .
A small pellet of <START:material> clay <END> was appliqued on the right side of the face , perhaps indicating an earring or chin plug.
A thin ribbon of <START:material> clay <END> encircled the neck , suggesting a necklace .
At Grewe , the figurine in Figure 9.3j had a sm all pebble pressed into the <START:material> clay <END> on each
It also had a bit of <START:material> clay <END> pinched up from the body high in the center of the chest .
It was com pletely blackened , and tiny flecks of <START:material> mica <END> were visible over its entire surface .
into some form of matting or basketry while the <START:material> clay <END> was still soft .

It was made of a buffware <START:material> clay <END> and was possibly a fragm ent of an animal effigy vessel .
It appeared that the <START:material> clay <END> surrounding it was broken off , indicating that a tail may have been attached , possibly with a stick .
The second fragm ent ( Figure 9.6b ) was made of fine <START:material> clay <END> and had a seam running the length of the posterior side .
Haury ( 1976 :266 ) described an example that he suggested had been pressed into the w all of a house while the <START:material> clay <END> was still pliable .If the Grewe figurines with im pressed backs were sim ilarly made , they would support the theory that they were used in a domestic setting ( Figures 9.2d , 9.3d , 9.4b ) .
However , the explosion of work at other Hohokam sites in recent years has shown that assemblages of ceram ics , <START:material> shell <END> , ground <START:material> stone <END> , food remains , other artifact types , and the behavioral interpretations derived from them did not always duplicate the patterns discerned at Snaketown .
These "brown paste variants " are not included under the " M iddle Gila " label , which is exclusively applied to coarse-grained <START:material> muscovite <END> schist-tempered red-on -
What is most needed right now are definitions that can aid us in time sequencing and <START:material> lead <END> to more replicable investiga­ tions .
The key component of their investigation is coarse-grained muscovite <START:material> schist <END> used as temper in the pottery .
for production source variability as much as possible , only buffware sherds containing coarse-grained muscovite <START:material> schist <END> were included in this analysis .
For Phase 2 , temper identification was solely oriented at determining whether the examined sherds contained m uscovite <START:material> schist <END> , and thereby inclusion in the study .
There does appear to be a temporal trend in the percentage of vessels containing sand as well as <START:material> schist <END> , as seen elsewhere in this volume , but temper is not viewed as areliable regional variable for seriation due to potential production source variability that may be unrelated to time ( see also Chapter 3 ) .
By recording only those sherds tem ­ pered ( at least in part ) with coarse-grained muscovite <START:material> schist <END> , it was hoped that the study would m inim ize potential production source stylistic variability .
4 . Sherds lacking coarse muscovite <START:material> schist <END> as temper or as part of the temper constituents .
This would <START:material> lead <END> to Snaketown being split into two tim e segments , an early Gila Butte segment would be split o ff from a later one which would be combined with Santa Cruz , Sacaton would be split into three segments , and Soho would rem ain discrete .
Temper : <START:material> Mica schist <END> and sand
This could <START:material> lead <END> one to think that the material is the work of a particular potter or group of potters , that the material is restricted in time and space , and therefore of little significance in the larger scheme .
Discussion , Late Gila Butte is marked by the advent of anew stylistic tradition that transcends ceramics , occurring on <START:material> shell <END> and stone jewelry , mortuary paraphernalia such as censers and palettes , and on rock art .
These rim/neck forms at first appear to be similar to those present on jars pre-dating the Sacaton tim e segments , and this can <START:material> lead <END> to confusion .
The times of attribute frequency convergence <START:material> lead <END> to suitable divisions .
In previous studies discussed briefly above ( W allace 1995 ; Wallace et al . 1995 ) , the author designated three horizon styles that are known to occur on ceramics , textiles , <START:material> shell <END> , ground <START:material> stone <END> , rock art , and other m edia in the Phoenix Basin .
We do not know when Style 1 was initiated , but it is safe to say that it predates the time of Christ , given rock art ( W allace and Holmlund 1986 :104-106 ) , <START:material> ceramic <END> ( Heidke
1999 ) , ground <START:material> stone <END> ( Huckell 1995 :66 , Fig . 4.9 ) , and dart point ( Cosgrove 1947 :51 ) data .
The difficulty determ ining where the middle Gila pottery was made lies in the strong possibility that nonlocal raw materials ( i .e . , coarse-grained mica <START:material> schist <END> ) were often used to temper the pots .
The coarse-grained , mica-rich <START:material> schist <END> that geologists identify as <START:material> Pinal Schist <END> , and which Hohokam archaeologists com monly call "micaceous <START:material> schist <END> , " was our first concern .
The rough-sort ( Chapter 1 ) and detailed sherd analysis ( Chapter 4 ) indicated that most of the GARP pottery was tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> , even though the geological terrain of the immediate vicinity around Grewe was devoid of the lustrous rock type ( see Chapter 2 ) .
If the GARP ceramics were made in the project area , then obviously a large quantity of the <START:material> schist <END> must have been brought to the site .
Strong evidence for frequent use of <START:material> schist <END> for local pottery making was notably absent .
Miksa 's ( Chapter 2 ) geological w ork identified the closest and , thus , most likely sources of <START:material> schist <END> .
As discussed below in the section on future directions , the challenge now is developing techniques to extract the necessary data from the <START:material> schist <END> tempering material in sherds that can be compared to source information .
The chemical approach can also be applied to pieces of <START:material> schist <END> found in archaeological contexts .
Our primary concern with such specimens was their potential use as temper , but the chemical sourcing can also be extended to implements made from the <START:material> schist <END> , such as palettes , tabular knives , and jewelry .
The detailed sherd analysis ( Chapter 4 ) indicated that even though the majority of the GARP pottery was tem ­ pered exclusively with crushed fragments of mica <START:material> schist <END> , a substantial quantity of sherds also contained sand .
Both plainware and buffware pottery from late Colonial , Seden­ tary , and Classic period contexts were especially likely to include sand in addition to the crushed <START:material> schist <END> .
Conclusions for the <START:material> Grewe Ceramic <END> Analyses/265
Consequently , the apparent restriction to the Gila River area of the key ingredients for fabricating buffware pottery ( i .e . , buff-firing clays and mica <START:material> schist <END> ) strengthens the claims for buffware specialization along the Gila River and the broad- scale distribution of the decorated pots from there .
For those sherds tempered with the <START:material> schist <END> alone , separate chemical analyses of both <START:material> clay <END> and <START:material> schist <END> will be required ( see the future directions section below ) .
The near absence of sherds tempered with South Mountain Granodiorite , Estrella Gneiss , <START:material> Camelback Granite <END> , <START:material> Squaw Peak Schist <END> , black phyllite/slate , and Taliesin Quartzite ( the tempers of the Phoenix area ) was especially remarkable because <START:material> mica <END> schist-temperedG ilaR iverpottery had a pervasive presence in the households of the lower Salt River valley .
For instance , during the Sedentary period , approxim ately 5 percent of the plainware ceramics in Canal System 2 , on the north side of the river , contained mica <START:material> schist <END> ( Abbott 1988 , 1997 , 1998b ; Henderson 1987a ; Mitchell and Lane 1990 ) .
The available data are sketchier from the Scottsdale Canal System , also on the north side of the Salt River , but indicate a substantial quantity of <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered Gila River pottery at Sedentary period settlements ( Hayton and Black 1994 ; Large et al . 1994 ) .
<START:material> The mica <END> schist variety represented more than 90 percent of the plainware pottery , indicating that the settlem ent 's inhabitants were primarily dependent on the potters to the south for their domestic inventories ( Abbott 1995a ) .
dem onstrated a substantial and perhaps a more frequent presence of <START:material> mica <END> schist-temp ered plain ware pottery overall , as compared to the subsequent Sedentary period collections ( e .g. , A bbott 1994a , 1997 ; Gregonis 1993 ; Henderson 1987a ; Mitchell and Lane 1989 , 1990 ) .
On this b asis and for the rem ainder of this discussion , we assume that the paucity of northern ceramics at Grewe , in conjunction with the relative ubiquity of <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered wares in the Phoenix area , indicated the one-way movem ent of pottery containers from the Gila to the Salt River valley .
Doyel ( 1991b ) also sum marized the evidence for other specialist-produced goods and com modities that probably moved in large am ounts through the Hohokam regional network , including plant foods and fibers , <START:material> shell <END> , manos , m etates , obsidian projectile points , tabular knives , palettes , ground stone axes , <START:material> argillite <END> , steatite , and serpentine .
Some theorists have conceptualized the prehistoric relationship between the " core-area " populations in the Phoenix Basin and those groups in the so-called "peripheral areas " as a dom inant realm and its political satellites or colonies ( e .g. , <START:material> Wood <END> and M cAllister 1980 ) .
Conclusions for the <START:material> Grewe Ceramic <END> Analyses/267
D istance from source seems to have played arole because the percentage of <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered utilitarian pots on the north side of the Salt River was generally less than on the southern side .
Smaller percent ­ ages of the <START:material> mica <END> schist-tempered ceramics reached Canal
The present study has dem onstrated a widespread abundance of buff-firing clays , and access to appropriate tempering materials was also probably unregulated , as witnessed by the generous use of mica <START:material> schist <END> in the plain- ware pottery .
Conclusions for the <START:material> Grewe Ceramic <END> Analyses/269
Moreover , these different plainware varieties ( i .e . , other <START:material> schist <END> , silver <START:material> phyllite <END> , other <START:material> phyllite <END> ) composed only sm all portions of the overall plainwware assemblage .
The majority of the Grewe pottery was plainware tempered with mica <START:material> schist <END> , and we do not know if there w ere different vessel forms within that set that each originated in a differ ­ ent production area .
We can speculate that the site was situated near a favored source of pottery <START:material> clay <END> , or fuel <START:material> wood <END> was particularly abundant nearby .
M arm aduke makes no m ention of mica <START:material> schist <END> , which we would expect in abundance , even though the <START:material> schist <END> would have had to have been transported some distance to the site .
The percentages of ceramics tempered with sand or rock types other than mica <START:material> schist <END> increased substantially from the Preclassic contexts at Grewe to the Soho phase contexts at Casa Grande North and Horvath ( Chapter 4) .
On the other hand , the shift may be nothing more than a technological change made by some potter groups that previously used mica <START:material> schist <END> to make their wares .
Another problem , analytically separating the particles of sand from the crushed fragments of mica <START:material> schist <END> in the sand and schist-tempered pottery , has recently been solved .
Petrographic counts of temper particles originating in sand versus those attributed to crushed <START:material> schist <END> must be discrim i­ nated because their places of origin differ .
For those ceramics that contained only the crushed fragments of the <START:material> schist <END> for temper , our best prospect for determ ining their source is the chemical variation in the <START:material> schist <END> .
Unfortunately , extracting uncontam inated and representative samples of the <START:material> schist <END> for ICPS assays from buffware sherds has proved im possible ( see Chapter 2 ) .
K illick was also especially im pressed with the large number of opaque minerals recorded by Miksa in the various <START:material> schist <END> thin sections , but which were not specifically identified due the analytical techniques em ployed .
If true , petro­ graphic scans for these key m inerals may hold the solution for precisely sourcing the <START:material> schist <END> in Hohokam pottery .
