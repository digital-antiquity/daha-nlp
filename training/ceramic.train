Starting from the premise that <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome  <END> was most frequent in the Tonto basin and Globe-Miami areas, he (Schmidt 1928:28 1) suggested that: It may be assumed that the appearance of the <START:ceramic> Gila ware  <END> in the Lower Salt region was accompanied by a new, though certainly short-lived culture epoch.
In a footnote (Schmidt 1928:281) he took a somewhat stronger position: ...judging from the [Los Muertos]...photographs [taken by Frank Cushing] in settlements of the Lower Salt region cremation is associated with the old Lower Salt [Red-on-buff] ware, inhumation with the more recent <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> , and it must be admitted that these criteria speak decidedly for a dual occupation.
Imported decorated pottery such as <START:ceramic> White Mountain Red ware <END> , <START:ceramic> Jeddito and Awatovi Black-on-yellow <END> , <START:ceramic> Gila and Tonto polychromes <END> , and <START:ceramic> Tusayan Black-on-white <END> from Puebloan and Salado groups in northeastern Arizona appears at sites in the Verde Confederacy in variable frequencies (North and Foster, 2002, p. 11; Stone, 2000, p. 208; Wilcox and Holmlund, 2007, p. 105).
Creek area are poorly understood, primarily because nearly all of the pottery from that area and across the upland tracts north of the lower Salt River valley has been lumped into a single type, <START:ceramic> Wingfield Plain <END> .
The Fort Mountain analysis contributed to an on-going ceramic research program in the northern territory that is working to establish ceramic provenance-related distinctions in the  <START:ceramic> Wingfield Plain <END> pottery.
For instance, previous analyses of <START:ceramic> Wingfield Plain <END> pottery have documented variation in surface color, smoothing, and polishing (e.g. Henderson and Rodgers 1979:92-94; Weaver 1974:25-34).
Of note, during my reanalysis of the pottery collected by LaFollette from AZ T:8:5(ASM), I encountered several phyllite-tempered pieces that were labeled as " <START:ceramic> Wingfield Red <END> ."
Plain ware sherds had a brown paste and were neither slipped red nor painted. Red ware sherds were distinguished by an oxidized iron-rich slip. Buff ware pottery included the  <START:ceramic> Hohokam red-on-buff <END> decorated types described by Haury (1945, 1976).
Sharp shoulders are common on <START:ceramic> Hohokam red-on-buff <END> vessels from the middle and late portions of the Sedentary period (Wallace 2001), but that jar form was rarely present among plain ware vessels except during the Classic period.

It was defined based on the presence of <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> pottery , the absence or very low frequency of decorated pottery , and radiocarbon dates that overlapped with those from Tortolita phase contexts in the Tucson Basin ( see Volume 1 , Chapter 11 ) .
Considerable effort was expended on documenting the com position of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery at Grewe , with the larger goal being to determine the scale of local pottery production .
The Grewe project presents the first opportunity to study <START:ceramic> buffware <END> provenance with the newly developed methods and techniques that have been previously applied to the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware pottery from the Phoenix area and elsewhere .
As described in this volume , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> provenance has proved to be a complicated , m ulti-faceted problem ,requiring an integrated analytical strategy that must reach beyond the Grewe study .
The immense value of Haury’s temporally based typology of decorated pottery has been repeatedly proved with alm ost every archaeological study in the Hohokam culture area since the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> types were first described ( Gladwin et al . 1937 ) .
Nonetheless , we may expect the derivation of temporally narrow er distinctions in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> variation .
The scale of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production is also explored in Chapter 6 via the variation in several technological and vessel form attributes associated with the decorated pottery .
In addition , direct evidence for pottery production in the excavation area is investigated in Chapter 7 , along with the results of replication studies devoted to better understanding the technology of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> produc­ tion .
Also , approxim ately 5 percent of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery at Sedentary and Classic period sites in Canal System 2 , on the north side of the Salt River , are micaceous im ported wares ( e .g. , Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1988 , 1997 , 1998b ; Cable and Gould 1988 ; Henderson 1987a ; Lane 1989b ) .
The <START:ceramic> plainware <END> exchange was interpreted as primarily gift-giving or other activities occurring in social contexts , rather than the barter between com modity producers and consumers ( Abbott 1994c ) .
The range of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessel shapes and sizes was im portant for gauging pottery production and distribution .
Haury ( 1976 ) documented a large suite of red-on-buff forms at Snaketown , where he also unearthed unequivocal evidence of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery making .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> sherds had a brow n paste and were neither slipped , painted , nor incised .
<START:ceramic> Buffware <END> pottery included the red-on-buff decorated types described by Haury ( 1945 , 1976 ) .
<START:ceramic> Grayware <END> sherds were gray- or brown-firing decorated ceramics that dated to the Pioneer period and were often conspicuous by deeply incised and regularly spaced grooves on their exterior surface ( see Haury 1976 ) .
<START:ceramic> Grayware <END> sherds that lacked painted designs and were not incised would have been misclassified as <START:ceramic> plainware <END> .
The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> grayware <END> specimens were categorized using the temporal sequence of decorated types described by Haury ( 1945 , 1976 ) .
Decorated sherds that could not be categorized as to type were coded as either “unidentified <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ” or “unidenti­ fied <START:ceramic> grayware <END> , ” depending on paste type .
<START:ceramic> Red-slipped <END> ceramics that had a thin , polished , pinkish brown slip , contained abundant amounts of coarse-grained mica schist , and lacked an interior smudge were classified as <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> in accordance with Haury’s ( Gladwin et al . 1937 ) type description .
<START:ceramic> Sacaton Red <END> sherds w ere character ­ ized by a thick , soft , raspberry red slip almost exclusively on the interior surface , and abundant am ounts of the mica - rich schist ( see Gladwin et al . 1937 ) .
The <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pieces were subdivided by temper alone , as having either a presence or absence of mica schist .
For the rough sort , other m iscella­ neous temper varieties , primarily those with undifferenti- atedcom positions of sand , constituted the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery categorized as lacking mica schist .
Also , we should note that none o fth e GARP ceramics contained fragments of the especially fine-grained and mica-poor black phyllite/slate that abundantly tempered some of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery found in the low er Salt River valley ( see Schaller 1994 ) .
The sherds categorized as “red/plain” were those that , for one reason or another , may have been a portion of a <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> vessel but lacked clear evidence of a slip .
The surface color would be black , brown , or yellow , however , which could not be definitely distin­ guished from a well-polished surface of a <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pot .
In addition , paste color was used to separate <START:ceramic> buffware <END> from <START:ceramic> grayware <END> , and incising on the exterior surface was another technological trait used for the rough-sort typology .
Notes on the Use of Design Attributes Haury ( 1945 , 1976 ; Gladwin et al . 1937 ) described in great detail the painted designs and vessel forms that characterized each <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> grayware <END> type .
Haury ( Gladwin et al . 1937 :108 ) noted that 85 percent of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowl and ja r exteriors were incised during the Gila Butte phase .
Sherds that bore Colonial period designs and were not incised were catego ­ rized as <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> , with one exception .
Buff3 65,779 582 552 ( 17.0) ( 9.0) ( 7.1 ) Polychrome 13 2 80 ( 0.0) ( 0.0) ( 1.0) Intrusive4 100 2 9 ( 0.0) ( 0.0) ( 0.1 ) Unknown 409 1 1 ( 0.1 ) ( 0.0) ( 0.0) Total 386,862 6,442 7,738 Notes :1 excludes clay objects that were not part of pots , such as figurines , raw clay , and construction daub;2 either redware or <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ; 3 includes decorated or incised 4grayware ; includes all non-Phoenix Basin pottery ; ( ) = percent of column total .
Consequently , a small number of the sherds lacking incising , which were categorized as Santa Cruz Red-on-buff for the rough-sort analysis , would have been classified by Wallace as <START:ceramic> Gila Butte Red-on-buff <END> .
This designation was warranted because <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls and scoops were rarely if ever made during the Classic period , and w e used the absence of incising to exclude the ceramic types that predated Santa Cruz Red-on - buff .
Following Haury’s chart of temporal trends in exterior bowl designs ( Gladwin et al . 1937 :111 ) , large rim sherds from bowls that lacked trailing lines were typically typed as <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> .
All bow l sherds that were not incised and had one or more trailing lines were called <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> .
Presence and Absence of Mica Schist in the GARP Redware and <START:ceramic> Plainware <END> Pottery .

by bands of short , parallel , uncapped fringe lines were invariably categorized as <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> , when incising was absent .
Similar to all Hohokam village assem blages , the pottery from all three sites was dom inated by <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds .
On the other hand , the mix of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , redware , and Salado polychrome pieces varied among the sites due to their chronological differences .
Both Casa Grande North and Horvath were exclusively Classic period settlements and contained more redware sherds and vessels than <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specimens .
The breakdown of the temper data showed that almost all of the Grewe <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware sherds contained rock fragments categorized as coarse-grained mica schist .
The temper in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> grayware <END> pottery was not systematically recorded , but we can confidently state that almost all of the decorated pieces also contained mica schist ( see also Chapter 4) .
Rock Samples The source of most of the coarser-grained mica schist used in both <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery in the middle Gila River valley is “Pinal Schist , ” a name given to a group of related rocks scattered among many mountain ranges in central to southern Arizona .
First , 15 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and 15 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds were grab sampled by David Abbott from features excavated during testing at Grewe .
The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds were selected from Pioneer through Sacaton phase contexts .
The <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds were selected not according to time interval , but from a spatially diverse set of contexts .
Later detailed analysis of additional samples revealed that many of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds at Grewe contained more sand temper , and coarser sand temper , than the initial random sample indi­ cated .
In the future , the sand model should be strengthened by the addition of point - counted sand samples and the construction of a more detailed flow chart , because the analysis of sand included in both <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery can clearly contribute to a much better understanding of provenance in the middle Gila River valley than we initially thought .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> sherds tended to have much more abundant temper than <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds , both in terms of having more plentiful grains of schist and in terms of having larger and more plentiful grains of non-schist sand .
The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds tended to have more clay lumps and often had large lumps of caliche that appear to have been added .2
Wei sm an felt that petrographic evidence m ight be used to characterize the provenance of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .
Work in the last decade has shown that the volume of pottery exchange in prehistoric central and southern Arizona , even of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots , was much greater than previously thought , and that specialized pottery production was com mon ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1998b ; Heidke 1996a , 1996b , 1998 ; Van Keuren et al . 1997 ) .
There is a great deal of temper variability in both the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery , but provenance is only one factor contributing to this variability .
She selected 20 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds from seven sites along the middle Gila R iver for ICPS analysis ( W alsh­ Anduze 1993c :75 ) .
Prior to the availability of sherds from the Grewe site , we selected three <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds from the M aricopa Road site that had abundant coarse sand - to granule-sized schist temper fragments .
The briquettes were abundantly tempered with coarse pieces of crushed schist , and the ease of rem oval of the schist from the terra cotta clay was approxim ately the same as that from the M aricopa Road <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds .
Petrographic Characterization of <START:ceramic> Plainware <END> and B uff ­ ware Sherds We noted above that the sand model was prem aturely abandoned as a means of characterizing temper provenance for the sherds because we had not developed a means for analyzing schist and sand com ponents of the temper sepa­ rately .
In the future , the sand model should be strengthened by the addition of point - counted sand samples and the construction of a more detailed flow chart , because the analysis of sand included in both <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery can clearly contribute to a much better understanding of provenance in the middle Gila River valley than we initially thought .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> sherds have larger and more abundant temper than <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds .
To apply the ICPS data to sherds , we rem oved schist temper manually from <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery , a technique that we think was largely successful .
The excavations at Grewe offered an excellent opportunity to begin a thorough and intensive research program aim ed at documenting the organization of production and distribution of these cele ­ brated but poorly studied <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramics .
The results of the Grewe ceramic rough-sort analysis ( Chapter 1 ) and Miksa’s petrographic data ( Chapter 2 ) , however , show that most of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery at Grewe is tempered with crushed , coarse-grained mica schist , a trait that typifies the utilitarian ware at various sites along the Gila River ( Haury 1976 ; Lascaux 1993 ; Rafferty 1982a ; Rice and Rafferty 1979 ) .
In this study , we continue the chemical w ork with the analysis of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> groups from Grewe and else ­ where .
Sorting the provenance-related variation from non ­ source-related “noise” in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> po ttery’s chemical makeup was particularly challenging .
As described below and despite these __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 48/Chapter 3 lim itations , the microprobe assays did disclose patterns of variation in both the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> specimens that were m eaningfully interpreted in provenance-related term s .
These studies were designed to determine the production loci of several <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties , following an analytical strategy com monly used in Europe ( Poole and Finch 1972 ; Tubb et al . 1980 ; W idemann et al . 1975 ) .
Sherds of the predom inant <START:ceramic> plainware <END> variety from seven Hohokam settlements were used as the reference groups .
The distinctions dem onstrated that the chemical variation in the clays used to produce Hohokam <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery was sufficient to distinguish the ceramics produced in various parts of the lower Salt River valley from one another .
It suggested that com positional and technological variation in Classic period <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery could be explained largely by production source differences ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1994c , 1995b ) .
The work for the M cDowell-to-Shea ( MTS ) project also included a first assessment of the coarse-grained mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery from the middle Gila River valley ( Abbott 1995b ) .
Finally , Crown ( 1983b ; Crown et al . 1988 ) has been responsible for all of the chemical analyses of the clay com pleted on Hohokam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery to date .
Three ceramic types ( Santa Cruz , Sacaton , and <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> ) were derived from seven sites situated along the three major drainages crossed by the aqueduct ( Gila River , Queen Creek , Siphon Draw ) .
As an aside , I used the weak acid extraction method __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Electron Microprobe Analyses of the GARP Pottery and R a w Clays/49 with ICPS ( see Burton and Simon 1993 ) to show that the paste of these brown paste variants chemically matched the paste of the locally made <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery .
These results supported the conclusion that the variants were essentially painted <START:ceramic> plainware <END> containers , which were made in small quantities in various parts of the low er Salt River valley ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ) .
In addition , Crown’s previous uninterpretable <START:ceramic> buffware <END> results and the recognition that Hohokam potters typically altered the chemistry of their <START:ceramic> buffware <END> clays also made for a pessimistic prediction for success with the red-on-buff samples .
On the other hand , our prior cognizance of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> artisans ’ behavior alerted us to potential hazards , allowing procedures to be form ulated in order to avoid these prob­ lems .
Also , the previous microprobe results with mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery did document a fairly wide range of chemical variation , holding out the prom ise of sufficient variability with which to distinguish between provenance-related <START:ceramic> plainware <END> groups .
Were <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots made there , or were the Grewe residents dependent on pottery makers at other settlements for their supply of household ceramic inventories ?
Clays sim ilar in color to the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery w ere readily obtainable by the Grewe villagers and were present in cultural deposits at the site .
STRATEGY AND SAMPLES Because most of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery from the middle Gila River valley was tempered with coarse-grained mica schist , a reference group approach , based on differences in temper , was im possible for the Grewe study .
These locations included 1 ) the Gila Butte site ( AZ U :13 :8[ASM ] , Motsinger 1993 ) , located im m ediately adjacent to numerous schist mines __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 50/Chapter 3 where large quantities of the tempering material were gouged from the flanks of Gila Butte ( see Rafferty 1982a ; Walsh-Anduze 1993c ) ; 2 ) the M aricopa Road site ( AZ T :16 :13[ASU]) , where Lascaux and Ravesloot ( 1993 ) encountered raw materials , tools , and facilities for pottery production ; 3 ) the Cholla Butte site ( AZ U :14:9[ A SM ] )' , located near the schist bedrock units in the Santan Moun­ tains and ju st across the Gila River from Grewe ; and 4 ) two sites along Q ueen Creek ( AZ U:11:2[ASU, AZ U:11:13 [ASU]) , where Antieau ( 1977 ) collected <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery with abundantam ounts of coarse-grained mica schist mixed with distinctive fragments of red sediment .
In addition , samples were chosen from Grewe , includ­ ing a <START:ceramic> buffware <END> set and several <START:ceramic> plainware <END> groups tempered with either 1 ) pure amounts of crushed , coarse-grained mica schist , 2 ) mica schist possibly m ixed with sand , 3 ) mica schist and red sediment , 4 ) silver phyllite , and 5 ) other schist that had a finer texture and many fewer muscovite platelets than the coarse-grained mica schist .
The groups of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> from Grewe containing these rock categories were included to assess the chances that they were derived from analytically distinguishable sources .
In all , a total of 179 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and 70 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds was included ( Table 3.1 ) .
A ll sherds were obtained from Sedentary period contexts , with the possible exception of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> samples from the Gila Butte site ( Table E.1 ) .
Also , 16 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds from Santa Cruz phase features at Grewe and one Pioneer <START:ceramic> plainware <END> case ( GRW- 163 ) were inadvertently selected for analysis .
The Santa Cruz cases proved to be chemically sim ilar to their <START:ceramic> plainware <END> counterparts from the Sacaton phase but , interest ­ ingly , the one Pioneer specimen proved to be quite distinct .
For instance , the distinctive Pioneer <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherd , GRW -163 , which was tempered with silver phyllite , was eliminated from the set of silver phyllite-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> for the statistical analyses .
Such a match would bolster any claims that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots were manufactured at the site .
DATA SCREENING AND TRANSFORMATION An experiment to determine the capacity of Hohokam <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds to undergo post-depositional chemical alterations indicated that the capacity was substantial ( see Abbott 1994b:Appendix D) .
From the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> assays , the data for three elements ( Mg , Ca , Ti ) were skewed and made quasi-norm al with a natural log transform ation .
The red-on-buff and raw clay analyses were handled differently from that of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> data in one important way .
As described in Chapter 7 , it was apparent that the ancient <START:ceramic> buffware <END> potters manipulated the chemical com posi­ tion to lighten the color of their ceramic fabric .
For both the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> data sets , box-and - whisker plots ( Tukey 1977:39-43 ) for each variable by analytical group revealed several extreme outliers in the groups .
STATISTICAL M ETHO DO LOG Y All statistical manipulations were accomplished using SPSS/PC+.Four standard m ultivariate statistical techniques ( H otelling’s T2 , discriminant analysis , principal com po­ nents analysis , hierarchical cluster analysis ) were utilized in various combinations for the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> studies .
In their original form , it was impossible to display graphically all of the data at once because they existed in a hyperspace whose axes corresponded to the original variables ( i .e . , 5 chemical elements for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and 8 elements for <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ) .
The Differentiation of <START:ceramic> Plainware <END> Sources Following the data screening , the analytical groups from Gila Butte , Cholla Butte , M aricopa Road , and Queen Creek were compared to one another in a series of pairw ise tests using H otelling’s T2 statistic .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> Production at Grewe Grewe was obviously a very large village and thus a location where we would expect the routine manufacture of utilitarian vessels for domestic consumption .
Based on the microscopic examination during the ceramic detailed analysis , most of the mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> at Grewe appeared to incorporate pure amounts of the crushed rock , whereas a sm all m inority probably included rock and m ineral particles derived from wash sand in addition to the schist fragments ( see Chapter 4) .
Consequently , both the sand-and-schist and pure schist <START:ceramic> plainware <END> cases were considered to be candidates for local production at Grewe .
It seemed reasonable to expect , therefore , that if mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> containers were made at Grewe , then an analyti­ cal group representing the site should be apparent in the chemical results .
Interestingly , C luster A included 12 of the 26 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> samples tempered with pure mica schist and only 2 of the 15 schist-and-sand cases .
Consequently , if we assume that the microprobe samples containing pure mica schist constituted an unbiased drawing from the universe of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> with that temper type , then we may infer that Cluster A represented nearly ha lf of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds at the site .2
Principal com ponents analysis of mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> : components 1 and 2. At this time , it is im possible to state with confidence that the Cluster A sherds and approxim ately h a lf of the Sacaton <START:ceramic> plainware <END> assem blage at Grewe , which the Cluster A samples represent , are the products of local artisans .
Their identity as a distinct analytical group probably produced at Grewe is assumed for the rem ainder of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> analysis in this chapter .
Other Plainware Varieties at Grewe The next topic concerned two relatively small sets of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery tempered with fragm ents of either silver phyllite or other schist .
Principal com ponents analysis of mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> : components 3 and 4 . from each other .
These findings supported the idea that the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties were not produced at Grewe but , instead , each was derived from its own source area , which was also separate from the four other production areas in the G ila River region sampled for this study .
Provenance of the Plainware Unknown Cases The final step for the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> study was a discrimin­ ant analysis , which included the five analytical groups tempered with coarse-grained mica schist .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> cluster analysis .
There were several good matches between the Grewe unknowns and all of the other analytical groups , suggesting that a broad-scale network of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> exchanges existed between the G rewe residents and their neighbors in the Gila River area .
In short , a sizeable percentage of the mica schist- tempered pottery at Grewe seemed to be more chemically like the sim ilarly tempered ceramics from other places in the region than to the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramics believed to have been made locally at the site .
If this idea is correct , then it would im ply that perhaps as much as h a lf of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery at Grewe was imported .
If correct , we could infer that the residents at Grewe were dependent on <START:ceramic> plainware <END> producers in many production areas for substantial portions of their household inventories .
Conclusion Apparently , the great majority of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery made and used in the middle Gila River valley was tem ­ pered with coarse-grained mica schist .
With regard to <START:ceramic> plainware <END> production at Grewe , the present data tentatively indicate that as much as ha lf of all undecorated , utilitarian ceramics at the site chemically clustered into a fairly tight analytical group .
On the other hand , the rem ainder of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery at Grewe , approxim ately 50 percent , may have been derived from various production sources scattered around the Gila R iver region .
BUFFWARE ANALYSIS Seventy Sacaton R ed-on-buff sherds from three sites were included in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> analysis ( Table 3.1 ) .
The Differentiation of <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sources Following the data screening ,the three analyticalgroups were compared to one another using H otelling’s T 2 statistic .
This result dem onstrated that there were m ultiple <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production sources that can be distinguished by the chem ­ ical variation in the source clays .
Provenance of the Buffware Outliers For the next phase of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> analysis , the three analytical groups were entered into a discriminant analysis .
This procedure was inform ative about the degree to which individual m em bers in each of the three <START:ceramic> buffware <END> groups could be statistically separated from one another .
Conclusion The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> findings were pleasantly surprising .
New research is currently aiming its sights on determ ining the way that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production and distribu­ tion was organized ( Abbott et al . 1997 ) .
For that work , the utility of the microprobe and other chemical assays of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> clay fractions were preliminarily discounted for the reasons noted above .
The limits to their utility rem ain to be determined , but the chemical characterizations have already yielded results with im portant implications for how we conceptualize <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
The microprobe data indicated that at least three sources were extant during the Sedentary period and , because all three of the sites sam pled thus far corresponded with an analytically distinctive <START:ceramic> buffware <END> group , it seemed likely that other locales were involved in the manufacture of decorated pots as well .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Electron Microprobe Analyses of the GARP Pottery and Raw Clays /65 Also , Lascaux and Ravesloot ( 1993 ) were two of the first researchers to present evidence that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots were made at locations other than the Snaketown-Gila Butte area .
Their inference of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production at the M aricopa Road site , based on their discoveries of pottery-m aking tools , facilities , and raw materials , was supported by the chemical differences between the M aricopa Road pottery and similar potsherds from Cholla Butte and Grewe .
Much rem ains to be learned about the organization of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production , but it is now safe to infer that it was not entirely limited to one or very few production centers .
<START:ceramic> Buffware <END> production at Grewe can be legitim ately hypothesized as well .
O f course , the possibility that Grewe was heavily dependent on a <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production source , other than the ones that supplied the ceramics at Cholla Butte and M aricopa Road , remains a feasible alternative explanation .
To further investigate <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production at Grewe , we next turn to an analysis of the raw clays that were readily available near the village , as w ell as some clay samples recovered from cultural contexts .
These sediments were probably deposited after the Seden­ tary period occupation at Grewe , but they were obviously representative of the clays that were readily available to <START:ceramic> buffware <END> artisans if , indeed , those potters labored at Grewe .
Results As for the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> analysis , the transform ed values for only five chemical elements were used to characterize the raw clay samples .
The clay data were mapped into the discriminant factor space created previously with the Cholla Butte , M aricopa Road , and Grewe <START:ceramic> buffware <END> analytical groups ( Figure 3.9 ) .
A ll of the raw clay samples were most sim ilar to the Grewe <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds , however , with the exception of the Snaketown sample , which plotted nearer to the Cholla Butte group .
This finding supports the idea that the form er cases were processed , but their dissim ilarity from the clay fraction in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceram ics implies that they were intended for some other purpose than pottery making .
If the chemical data from the Snaketown potter’s clay was indicative of the Snaketown pottery , then an analytical group from Snake- town m ight also be chemically distinct from the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramics at the other three sites .
These chemical d iffer ­ ences , therefore , further raise our expectations concerning the microprobe’s utility for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> provenance studies .
Discussion Apparently , there was no shortage near Grewe of buff ­ firing clay deposits , which , in a gross chemical sense , were sim ilar to the clays used to make the Grewe <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .6
CONCLUSION The two principal issues that guided the chemical study concerned 1 ) the utility of microprobe assays for deriving provenance-related inferences about <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and b u ff ­ ware pottery in the middle Gila River valley , and 2 ) ascertaining if clay containers were made at Grewe .
Thus far , five <START:ceramic> plainware <END> analytical groups from Gila Butte , Cholla Butte , M aricopa Road , Queen Creek , and Grewe have been successfully discriminated from one another , as have three <START:ceramic> buffware <END> groups corresponding to Cholla Butte , M aricopa Road , and Grewe .
M ajor portions of the plain- ware and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> assemblages at the site were chemically differentiable from the pottery at all of the other locations sampled for the compositional research .
A second goal concerned production differences for the redware , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery over time .
Another aspect of technological variability over time concerned the validity and temporal significance of the <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> and <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> types .
<START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> is said to be one of the best diagnostics for the Vahki phase , a temporal interval that predated the produc­ tion of Hohokam decorated ceramics .
<START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> may have been the technological precursor of the Classic period redware pottery and had a short duration ( 50-100 years ) at the end of the Sacaton phase .
The type has been character ­ ized as having many of the technological traits of the later <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> wares but without their technical sophistication .
The defining attributes of both the <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> and Vahki Plain types are only vaguely specified , however , making their recognition difficult and causing some analysts to doubt their chronological utility ( e .g. , Abbott , ed . , 1994 : 323-325 ; Haury 1987 :249-250 ) .
THE SAMPLE The sherd assem blage was divided into five main categories : 1 ) <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , 2 ) <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , 3 ) redware , 4 ) red/plain , and 5 ) Salado polychrome .
The red/plain category included all sherds suspected to be part of a <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> vessel , but due to each sherd’s condition could not be positively identified as such .
Because of the great number of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and redware sherds from the fieldwork , only a sample could be examined in detail .
To bolster the number of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and Pioneer redware sherds analyzed from Grewe , a second set of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and redware pieces that could be identified as to type were selected from temporally mixed deposits .
All of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> samples were selected from the best-dated deposits .
<START:ceramic> Buffware <END> sherds from the best-dated contexts that were categorized during the rough-sort analysis as either uniden­ tified <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , unidentified <START:ceramic> buffware <END> with incising , or as an“either/or” type ( e .g. , Santa Cruz/Sacaton_Red-on-buff ) were assigned specific type and temporal designations based on their depositional context .
In contrast , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and redware sherds whose type assignments were temporally inconsistent with their recov­ ery context were eliminated from consideration ( e .g. , a <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> sherd in a Sacaton phase feature ) .
For instance , the presence/absence of a smudge was recorded only for <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware sherds because the decorated types were never smudged .
However , many of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramics from Hohokam sites along Queen Creek contain a distinctive rock type , called “red sediment , ” “red arkose” ( Antieau 1977 ) or “ silty argillite” ( Kamilli 1993 ) .
The chemical assays described in Chapter 3 also indicated that <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds tempered with silver phyllite probably originated in their own production area .
A series of measurem ents was recorded for each specim en using a plastic , transparent template that was divided into nine contiguous 1 x 1 cm squares placed over the center of the sherd’s <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> surface .
Second , the number of the <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> squares was counted in which only zero to two temper particles were visible on the surface .
Third , the num ber of the <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> squares was counted in which three to five grains of temper were visible .
Finally , the num ber of <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> squares was determined that were so eroded or covered with caliche as to significantly im pair the counting of the temper particles .
Red Slip Color Slip color was recorded for redw are sherds as 1 ) the yellow -red associated with the <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> type ( Schroeder 1940 ) , 2 ) the orange associated with <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> ( Schroeder 1940 ) , 3 ) the raspberry red typical of <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red <END> ( Abbott and G regory 1988 :14-16 ) , 4 ) the magenta of Phoenix Red ( Abbott and G regory 1988 :19-22 ) , and 5 ) the pinkish - brown of <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> .
These values were consistent with previous research ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; Abbott 1988 :140 , 1995b :61 ) , except that the color associ­ ated with <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> was added for this study .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> and Redware Surface Finish Polishing is achieved with a smooth , hard object that is rubbed back and forth over a po t’s leather-hard surface .
Four types of polishing were recorded for the redware and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds : a lustrous surface without polishing striations , a lustrous surface with polishing striations , polishing striations on an otherw ise matte surface , and polished but of unknown degree .
For <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , a surface was recorded as floated when temper , except mica , was not visible on the surface .
For Hohokam <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , vitrification probably represents overfiring because an irregular , bubbly surface resulted on exterior patches of the vessel .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> surfaces exhibiting bub­ bling were categorized as vitrified .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> surfaces that were not polished , floated , or vitrified were coded as none .
Haury ( 1976 :225 ) noted that at Snaketown , what probably was fortuitous blackening was sometimes present on the interior surfaces of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , and that the blacken­ ing was never associated with a polish .
For the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware , only rim , neck , or shoulder sherds were listed as scoops , jars , and bowls .
Paint location was a good indicator of vessel form for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds , allowing vessel form for many red-on-buff body sherds to be recorded .
A second goal for the vessel form analysis was a diachronic assessment of how <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and redware pots contributed to the functional com position of the household inventories .
We wanted to know , for instance , if developments in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production reflected a growing and then a shrinking reper ­ toire of vessel forms constructed by <START:ceramic> buffware <END> artisans , or was it related to some other factor , such as temporal changes in dem and for containers with the particular functions served by decorated pots .
For exam ple , previous studies of the Sedentary and Classic period vessel forms at Las Colinas and Pueblo Grande revealed that in the Phoenix area the red-on-buff , <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , and <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> bowls overlapped considerably in how they were used .
The precipitous decline of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery in those villages over time was not associated with achanging functional character of the household inventories but rather to a replacem ent of decorated bowls , first by locally made <START:ceramic> plainware <END> forms and later by burgeoning redware production , mostly on the south side of the Salt River ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1988 ; A bbott and Walsh­ Anduze 1995 ) .
Finally , we looked at the association between vessel forms and different <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties distinguished by temper type .
We wanted to know , therefore , if specific sizes or shapes of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots were brought to the GARP sites from these outlying areas .
On the other hand , the percentages of redware , buff ­ ware , and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pieces changed greatly over the occupational sequence .
By the Soho phase , however , the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> tradition fell into steep decline , with redware and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels making up the difference .
Consequently , we may infer some functional overlap or interchangeable service for the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , decorated , and <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> pottery at Grewe , Casa Grande North , and Horvath .
For instance , both <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls were spread among all of the size classes during the Preclassic ( Figures 4.5 through 4.8 ) .
Moreover , the sizes of redware and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls similarly over ­ lapped in the Soho phase assem blage ( Figure 4.9 ) .
We have already noted a rise in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> percentage during the Santa Cruz phase , which , according to the data in Tables 4.5 through 4.7 , appears to have been primarily the result of an increase in decorated bowls .
phase , on the other hand , the production of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jars increased considerably .
Also , as noted previously at Las Colinas and Pueblo Grande , the decline of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> tradition was accelerated further during the Soho phase with replacem ent of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls and jars by some <START:ceramic> plainware <END> forms but mostly by <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> pots .
Regardless of the reason , it is interesting that an increasing proportion of the very large forms seems to have been given to <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramics over time ( see Figures 4.6 through 4.8 ) .
This temporal shift suggests another functional equivalency , in this instance between the very large plain- ware cases and the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls that replaced them .
The custom ary construction of flared rim angles during the Colonial and Sedentary periods is well documented in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> assem blages and is generally considered a stylistic expression unique in the Southwestern deserts rather than a __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 80/Chapter 4 Table 4.7 .
Wall angle dissimilarities betw een <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> forms , on the other hand , could indicate important functional differences .
The results showed that flared rims w ere mostly confined to <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls , especially those in Colonial and Seden­ tary period contexts ( Table 4.8 ) .
As with the aperture diameters , the buff , red , and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowl assem blages shared sim ilarw all angle distributions , suggest ­ ing their functional overlap .
If the Grewe residents used bowls for short-term storage , food preparation , consumption , and serving , which are tasks typically associated with unrestricted vessel forms ( Braun 1980 ) , then the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , and redware containers probably served those tasks with some degree of utilitarian equivalence over the lifespan of the settlements in the project area .
A lthough there was some overlap , the aperture data implied that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ja rs func­ tioned in a restricted set of tasks as compared to the plain- ware vessels .
The apparent replacem ent of some <START:ceramic> plainware <END> jars by <START:ceramic> buffware <END> counterparts during the Sedentary period sug­ gested some degree of functional overlap between the wares , but it is also quite clear that large <START:ceramic> plainware <END> jars were always made for jobs that were not intended for decorated forms .
In contrast , the red-on-buff jars and probably equivalently shaped <START:ceramic> plainware <END> forms were likely used for serving and consum ing liquids or as small storage containers ( see Braun 1980 ; Crown 1983a ) .
During the Soho phase , mostly small <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jars continued to be made , but redware producers also supplied the demands for jars with either narrow or wide apertures ( Figure 4.16 ) .
The size range of the redware pots probably indicated their use for tasks that formerly had been reserved for the unadorned <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery .
Second , those <START:ceramic> plainware <END> rim sherds tempered with mica schist , mica schist and sand , other schist , or undifferentiated sand were about equally split between bowls and jars .
inconsistent with the sizes of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> forms tempered with the various other rock and sand types ( Tables 4.11 and 4.12 ) .
The data are too few to be certain , but there seemed to have been few , if any , vessel form differences between these <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties .
im ported <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery , as compared to the locally made bowls and jars .
The variety of forms with each of the temper types implies that specialized production and supply of specific forms from particular production sources was not evident , nor was there reason to believe that the im ported vessels largely contained and transported a particular com modity , as we m ight expect if only jars of a certain size dom inated one or more of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> Vessel Forms by Temper Type .
Discussion Tem poral changes in the relative am ounts of buff , red , and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery in Hohokam assem blages have been recognized for more than six decades ( Gladwin et al . 1937:Fig .
Thus far , we have noted an identical temporal sequence in both the lower Salt and middle Gila areas , w hereby the rise and decline of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> tradition happened similarly across the region .
The relative am ount of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery first increased during the Colonial and Sedentary periods with a greater production of decorated bowls and then jars .
The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> tradition then declined with a replacement of red-on-buff bowls by <START:ceramic> plainware <END> equivalents and , later , declined still further with the substitution of redware ceramics for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls and jars .
Instead , buff , red , and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls were apparently interchangeable in a strict utilitarian sense , and their relative quantities at any one time were probably determ ined by the forces of supply and demand .
Probably across much of the Hohokam territory and during all tim e periods , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jars w ere smaller , on average , and probably served a more restricted set of tasks as compared to <START:ceramic> plainware <END> forms .
Finally , now that we have documented how the sizes and shapes of vessels varied from one temporal context to the next and among different <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties , it will be possible to control for the effect of vessel form on techno­ logical variability .
For instance , we also determ ine if the technological fluctuations found in the local <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties at Grewe , Casa Grande North , and Horvath were apparent in the pottery with other temper types , which presum ably were im ported from other produc­ tion sources .
Plainware Technology As noted above , most of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery was tempered with mica schist or mica schist and sand , which was true for all of the temporal phases .
Among the other <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties , sherd temper was equally rare ( silver phyllite : n=0 , other phyllite : n=3 , other schist : n=3 ) .
Streaky and striated exterior finishes , without overall luster , were always a hallmark of the GARP <START:ceramic> plainware <END> assem blage .
The temporal breakdowns for the exterior surface finishes on the two phyllite and the other schist varieties were also similar , although surface polishes were almost always more common on these other <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramics than on the micaceous cases ( compare Tables 4.14 and 4.15 ) .
In addition , smudging on the other <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties was also dissimilar .
For w hatever reason and presum ing that the schist in both varieties was acquired from the same bedrock source , it seemed that potters who added sand to their <START:ceramic> plainware <END> paste also crushed their schist less thoroughly , as compared to the artisans who relied exclusively on the crushed-schist fragm ents .

astrong indicator of gradual technological modifications over time , whose implications for raw material procure ­ ment , pottery-m aking routines , and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sourcing rem ain to be determ ined .
Also of note , the Pioneer set differed the most from the other sets , which is a them e we will return to when evaluating the technological validity of the <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> type .
Following the Pioneer period , the average density changed without a temporal trend and the m edian density value changed not at all , suggesting uniform ity in the am ount of crushed schist that was added to the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> clay ( see Table 4.17 ) .
Discussion The technological differences among the various <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties andthetechnological trends and changes over tim e that were not in lock step from one variety to the next are the kinds of variation that imply independence among the pottery manufacturers .
Not only were different materials used to make the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> containers , but also the potters in different areas had divergent ideas and methods for producing their wares .
Moderate numbers of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots with silver phyllite , other phyllite , and other schist were brought into the Grewe vicinity , suggesting regular contacts between the GARP area residents and the nonlocal suppliers of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels .
These results contrast with recent findings from the lower Salt River valley , where the different <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties made in the same canal system were technologi­ cally sim ilar to one another ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; Henderson and Abbott 1995 ) .
Vahki Plain <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> was first described in 1937 as the precursor to the <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> type , following the first excavations at Snaketown ( Gladwin et al . 1937 :211-212 ) .
<START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> , unlike its technologically inferior but more extensively used successor , was argued to characterize an earlier and much shorter temporal interval : the Vahki phase .
When the type was initially defined , great confidence was expressed about its taxonom ic utility by Gladwin et al . ( 1937 :212 ) : “The thinness , form , finish , and com position of paste are distinctive and thereby create a greater differ ­ ence between Vahki and <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> than between Gila __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 92/Chapter 4 Plain of any two phases . ”
In more recent years , however , Haury ( 1976 :225 , 1987 :249-250 ) expressed doubts about one’s ability to distinguish the <START:ceramic> early plainware <END> from the undecorated pottery that replaced it , and thus questioned the ty p e’s value as a temporal diagnostic .
An exact and systematic comparison of <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> and <START:ceramic> early Gila Plain <END> ceramics has never been published , includ­ ing precise m easurem ents of the attributes said to distinguish the two types .
Consequently , <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds and vessels continue to be classified as <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> and thus are associ­ ated , on taxonomic grounds , with an early and narrow time frame ( e .g. , Cable and Doyel 1987 ) .
In this sectio n , we present a m etho dolo gy to evaluate the typological significance of the earliest Pioneer <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery .
<START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> was described as a mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramic characterized by thin vessel walls , a narrow range of small and sim ple vessel forms , well-finished exterior surfaces , and containing a great profusion of finely divided mica particles ( G ladw in et al . 1937 :21 1 ; Haury 1976 :225 ) .
Also , the walls of all <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> pots were said to be characteristically thin regardless of vessel size and general form ( Haury 1976 :223 ) , which may have restricted the po tter’s ability to construct larger and more elaborate shapes .
We included only mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and used a suite of technological and vessel form variables , including mica size , mica density , exterior surface treatment , rim angle , wall angle , aperture diameter , and thickness measurem ents .
Each trait corresponded specifically to a property said to distinguish the <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> type .
The data relevant to vessel form indicated , as predicted , that the sizes and shapes of the Pioneer I <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls were small and sim ple .
Haury ( 1976 :223 ) stated that the <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> sherds at Snaketown averaged around 4 mm in thickness , whereas the <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> sherds were bulkier at 6 to 8 mm .
Finally , we searched the two temporal sets for sherds that would m eet three of the expectations for <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> sherds : 1 ) a polished exterior surface , 2 ) a high density of mica ( 8 or more squares ) , and 3 ) small mica flakes ( < 0.5 __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Detailed Sherd Analysis/93 mm ) .
If , in fact , Vahki phase ceramics were present in substantial quantities , then we failed to distinguish them with the traits said to discriminate the <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> type .
However , differences betw een the early and late Pioneer sets were not apparent for those attributes touted as the most discriminating between the Vahki and <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> types : wall thickness , mica size , and exterior surface treat­ ment .
In recent work , it was found at several locations that some <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramics used during the Vahki phase contained no mica schist and were technologically dissimilar from <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> ( Cable and Doyel 1987 ; Deaver and Ciolek-Torrello 1995 ; Kisselburg 1989 ) .
As such , if our results are verified with more rigorously obtained samples , then we would concur with Cable and Doyel ( 1987 :49 ) that the primary diagnostic of the Vahki phase was not <START:ceramic> Vahki Plain <END> but the absence of decorated pottery .
Redware Technology Five collections of <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> sherds were examined for this analysis , including <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> pottery from Grewe , early and late Soho phase assem blages from Casa Grande North , Soho phase redw are from Horvath , and the Civano phase pottery from Com pound D at Casa Grande .
A ll <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> sherds were tempered with copious am ounts of mica schist , whereas a mix of different temper types was present among the Classic period sets ( Table 4.18 ) .
The <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> varieties containing rock and sand types other than mica schist , or mica schist and sand , are discussed more thoroughly in a following section .
<START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> Twenty-one <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> sherds from Grewe were among those specimens analyzed for the detailed analysis .
Slip colors were mostly the pinkish brown associated with the <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> type ( n=17 ) , although some variation was noted , including cases with slips of yellow-red ( n=1 ) , raspberry red ( n=2 ) , and one indeterm inate case .
One of Schroeder’s major contributions was nam ing a new type , <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> .
It was characterized by an orange slip and “sand ” temper , which distinguished the new type from the yellow- <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> and mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> type .
Schroeder also suggested that <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> was a diagnostic for the Civano phase , whereas <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> was associated with the Soho part of the Classic period .
For instance , mica schist temper was strongly associated with ceramic production in the Gila River valley , and the “sand ” temper , often found in <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> pottery , is South Mountain Granodiorite .
Most recent work has involved ceramics recovered from Phoenix area sites , and thus how the technological attributes o fthe <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> pottery from the Gila River valley changed over time is still poorly under ­ stood .
Contrary to the sharp distinctions described in Schroeder’s ( 1940 ) temporal scheme , the yellow-red associated with mica schist temper and the <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> type was a common trait in all of the temporal sets .
Schroeder’s ideas , the orange slips associated with <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> did not increase in frequency over time .
Striated surfaces were also another defining characteristic of Schroeder’s <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> type , whereas lustrous finishes typified <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> examples .
<START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> In the first descriptions of <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> ( Colton and Hargrave 1937 :175-176 ; Gladwin and Gladwin 1933 :28-29 ; Hawley 1936 :108 ) , the type was considered to be intermediate between <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> and <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> and , due to its evolutionary character , to mark the late Sedentary/early Classic time period .
With the exception of Colton and Hargrave , who ascribed an irregularly striated exterior finish to the type , <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> was described as having a smoothed and unpolished exterior surface with a dull , light terra cotta or light brick red color , and sometimes a blackened but unpolished interior .
There is no m ention of an actual slip in the earliest descriptions , although later both Schroeder ( 1940:118 ) and Hayden ( 1957:184 ) indicated that a thin red slip or wash was applied to <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> pots .
Gladwin and Gladwin ( 1935 ) reported the occurrence of <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> accompanied by typical <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> pottery at Adamsville , a few kilom eters up-canal from Grewe .
It was the upper portion of Trash Mound 11 at Site 62 , in the Scottsdale are , where he found <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> ( 0.2-0.7 % of the total pottery ) and <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> together .
Both vessels were poorly finished and not smudged , and were tentatively typed as <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> .
Finally , at Pueblo Grande , Hayden ( 1957:184 ) found poorly finished redware sherds associated with <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> in two pit houses .
Recent work centered in Canal System 2 , in the northern portion of the lower Salt River valley , has rejected the validity of a redware type that was technologically and temporally transitional between the Gila_Plainware of the Sedentary period and the <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> ceramics of the Classic period , at least for the Phoenix area .
It was shown that <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> pots probably were made in the Phoenix area during the Sacaton phase , including both the Squaw Peak Schist-tempered and phyllite-tempered varieties ( Abbott 1988 ; Mitchell and Lane 1989 :85-86 ) .
In these ways , they matched the <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> description .
On the other hand , the Squaw Peak Schist-tempered and phyllite-tempered ceramics were not in an evolutionary sequence from <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> to Classic period redware .
Moreover , these ceramics did not “evolve” into the redware types thought previously to represent the Classic period ( i .e . , <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> and <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> ) .
We now know that the <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> type was a product of the Gila River valley artisans , and those ceramics associated with the <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> label were mostly made in the southern portion of the lower Salt River valley ( see above and Abbott and Walsh-Anduze 1995 ) .
For instance , even the earliest Soho phase features at Casa Grande North corresponded to a time when the replacem ent of Sacaton Red-on-buff by <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> was complete .
Also , a l lo fth e redware pieces associated with Sacaton R ed ­ on-buff in the Grewe contexts that were sampled for the detailed analysis were either <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red <END> or stray sherds of <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> .
Consequently , transitional assemblages characterized by <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> and “Classic period-like” redware ceramics were absent from the excavated collections .
Nevertheless , we did note some temporal trends in the Classic period redware technology , which , if projected backward to the transitional interval , would fit the type description of <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> .
In fact , when we searched for sherds that matched the <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> profile ( i .e . , a patchy and thin slip , a matte exterior finish , and no smudge ) only four cases among those listed in Table 4.27 met all four criteria .
Therefore , if a distinct and temporally diagnostic <START:ceramic> Santan Red <END> type did exist in the Gila River valley , the pottery remains as elusive as ever .
Buffware Technology We next investigated the variation associated with three aspects of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> technology : temper , mica size , and sherd temper .
The reader can find in Chapters 6 and 7 our treatments of other <START:ceramic> buffware <END> variables that concern the standardization of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacture and specialized analyses of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> technology .
The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sample for the present discussion encompassed all of the sherds examined for the detailed analysis that were identified as to type .
In addition , we included unidentified <START:ceramic> grayware <END> sherds , whichprobably were portions of early Pioneer pots and unidentified examples of <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-gray <END> .
Temper Only three temper types were represented among the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> samples , including crushed mica schist , mica schist and sand , and a heterogeneous set of undifferentiated sand tempers .
The paucity of sherds without some amount of coarse-grained mica schist dem onstrated that the glittery rock type was a highly desired ingredient for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacturing , especially during the Preclassic ( Table 4.29 ) .
One hypothesis to explain the variability depended on an assumed correspondence between sand com position and pottery production source , perhaps indicating a kind of decentralization or an expansion of the number of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> suppliers during the Soho phase .
Follow-up w ork using Miksa’s ( Chapter 2 ) geologically based , sand com position model and petrographic analyses of <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> pottery could be utilized to test this proposition .
We also discovered a progressive increase across time in the percentage of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds tempered with mica schist and sand at the expense of the pure schist category ( see Table 4.29 ) .
At present , it is difficult to interpret the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> po tters ’ expanding reliance on sand temper through time .
Alternatively , perhaps the territorial range of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production was stable over time but arrangements were altered in the social and economic networks through which <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots were exchanged .
Perhaps <START:ceramic> buffware <END> makers everywhere used the same temper and clay recipe and responded equally to a reduced supply of schist .
For now , we can only state that the chronological trend for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> temper exem plified the huge potential for behavioral and social inferences that remains untapped and embedded in the technological variability of the decorated ware .
The m edian size for the <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-gray <END> sherds was smaller than the value associated with the <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-buff <END> pottery .

Fortunately , the developm ent of petrographic and chemical methods for untangling these dimension of variation is now well underway , as described in Chapters 2 and 3. We can expect , therefore , that the temporal patterns reported here w ill ultim ately engender more exact and unambiguous inferences about <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production , distribution , and technological changes over time .
CERAMIC EXCHANGE Background In the lower Salt River valley , petrographic analysis has provided detailed inform ation about the temper fraction in <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware ceramics , and geological work has established the source areas for those tempers .
During the Classic , <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery was produced locally Table 4.32 .
<START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sherd Temper by Temper Type .__ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Despite production at the local level , <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots of various shapes and sizes commonly changed hands .
Consequently , the distribution of the fancier <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> pots differed from the movement of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> containers .
<START:ceramic> Red-slipped <END> containers commonly traveled across community boundaries as part of the economic transactions , although only small and m edium -sized bowls and some small jars , for the most part , were exported from the source area .
At that time , <START:ceramic> plainware <END> production was an activity mostly associated with specialists .
In fact , most <START:ceramic> plainware <END> makers specialized in the production of a restricted repertoire of vessel forms .
In many parts of the Salt River valley , mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> from the Gila River area was a frequent element of the ceramic inventories , including those in the Scottsdale ( Abbott 1995b ) , Mesa __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 102/Chapter 4 ( Abbott 1995a , 1998b ) and in Canal System 1 , on the south side of the Salt River ( Abbott 1998b ; Gregonis 1993 ) .
Only one sherd of the more than 4,100 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pieces examined for the detailed analysis was derived from a Phoenix area source , a quartzite and schist- tempered specimen probably made in the Scottsdale Canal System .
Intra-Valley Exchange <START:ceramic> Plainware <END> .
One exception is the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> variety tempered with mica schist and red sediment , which was made along Queen Creek .
This variety represented only about 1 percent of the total <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery in the GARP collections , but its abundance jum ped to 3 percent in the Sacaton set , where most of the red sediment-tempered sherds were concentrated ( see Table 4.13 ) .
When we m erged these two varieties , their combined percentage steadily declined from a high of 92 percent of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> total during the Pioneer period to a low 44 percent in the Soho phase assemblages at Casa Grande North and Horvath .
O f course , the assum ption here is that the geographical range over which mica schist was used to make <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery was stable over time .
Unfortunately , we still do not know the sources of the various <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties , so it is difficult to derive precise interpretations about the exchange patterns and their sociological significance .
The redware data m irrored those of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> .
Notably absent at the Classic period settlements were <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> pieces com posed of silver phyllite temper .
Also , ju st as we saw with the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , the redware sherds tempered with other phyllite were found only in the late deposits at Casa Grande North and Horvath .
Obviously , we cannot define the distribution networks for the redware and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramics in the Gila River valley from data in one project area .
It is intriguing , however , that changes in the suppliers of the GARP redware pottery exactly paralleled those changes for the GARP <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceram ics .
This equivalence between <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware exchanges were dissimilar from the situation in Phoenix , where the distribution of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware pots varied due to production differences .
This count does not include Gila and <START:ceramic> Tonto Polychrome <END> , which are types that may or may not have been made in the middle Gila River valley ( cf .
The paste was similar to typical Hohokam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> in texture , color , and composition , but both surfaces had a patchy pink slip and purple paint .

At Grewe , these types were rare , and <START:ceramic> Rincon Red-on-brown <END> pots were more frequently represented .
At the Horvath site , there were several unidentified redware pieces , two sherds of <START:ceramic> Pinto Polychrome <END> , two corrugated sherds with different characteristics , an unidentified whiteware , and two Tanque Verde Red-on - brown cases , probably from the Tucson Basin .
The chemical results reported in Chapter 3 imply that at least some of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery containing mica schist and sand were imported from production sources located in other parts of the middle Gila River valley .
Consequently , while these two <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties are assumed to be the locally made pottery , they undoubtedly included at least some nonlocal specimens .
Based on the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> types present , the whole vessel assem blage appeared to be skewed tow ard the late Colonial and Sedentary periods .
O f the 41 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels in the collection , 90 percent were identified as either Sacaton or <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> .
A bbott ( 1985 ) , for example , found that the number of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots in Snake- town burials far exceeded the am ount found in trash contexts .
A third issue is <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessel form variability .
Data from both the whole vessels and the detailed rim sherd analysis were compared with the assemblage of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessel forms found at Snaketown , a site of known <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production ( Haury 1976 :194-197 ) .
We w ere interested to learn , therefore , whether the assemblage of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessel forms at Grewe had a range of variation that matched that of the Snaketown collection or if only a subset of Snake- town vessel forms was present , perhaps indicating that the villagers at Grewe im ported red-on-buff pots rather than produced them .
A total of 22 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , 24 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and 26 redware variables was recorded .
Patterned Polishing and Fireclouds The presence of patterned polishing striations was recorded for both the interior and exterior surfaces of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redware vessels .
Likewise , fireclouds were coded as present and patterned , present and unpatterned , present but indeterminate , or absent for <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and redw are pots .
RESULTS Of the 87 whole vessels recovered at Grewe , there were 36 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , 41 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and 9 redw are pots , and 1 Gila Polychrome ja r ( Table 5.2 ) .
Nearly 70 percent of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels were intact or easily reconstructible .
All <START:ceramic> buffware <END> cases were recovered from Grewe , ranging from the Sweetwater through the Sacaton phase ( Table 5.3 ) .
The Pioneer and early Colonial periods were m inim ally represented ; however ; at least 90 percent of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels were attributable to the Santa Cruz and Sacaton phases .
Finally , one <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> jar was recovered from the floor of Feature 46 , a structure at H orvath ( west locus ) .
It consisted of one plainw are jar ; one plate , six censers , and one bighorn sheep effigy censer of uniden­ tified <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ; one jar from the Santa Cruz phase ; two large storage jars , one m iniature jar , six bowls , three scoops , and one rectangular vessel from the Sacaton phase ; and a single Santa Cruz or Sacaton m iniature jar .

Of the six reuse vessels , three were scoops made from large <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ja r sherds ( Figure 5.3a-c ) .
Of the five m iniature vessels , there were one <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jar , two <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls , one <START:ceramic> plainware <END> jar , and one jar of indeterminate paste ( Table 5.5 ) .
One of the m iniature <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls ( specim en 4585 ) also came from a stripping unit ( Figure 5.5c ) .
The other <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowl ( specimen 15338 ) was recovered from the floor of pit house Feature 1216 ( Figure 5.5d ) .
It was better constructed than the first <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowl , but it did exhibit some of the variation in thickness characteristic of pinchpots .
Some shallow incising was evident on its exterior surface , a characteristic generally associated with <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots from the G ila Butte phase , but not with <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels .
Of the five miniature vessels , both the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> jars and the wide , shallow <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowl exhibited pastes and tempers sim ilar to the those identified during the detailed sherd analysis .
The indeterm inate ja r and the smaller <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bow l did not exhibit these similarities , the form er due to its unidentifiable clay and its undifferentiated sand temper , and the latter due to its temper com position of underprocessed silver phyllite .
Com positional variables for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots , including caliche content and paste and surface colors , were compared with the sherd data .
Sixty percent of these cases were <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots , compared to about 45 percent of the non-mortuary whole vessel assemblage ( Table 5.6 ) .
O f 60 sets of three or more sherds from a single vessel that was less than 50 percent present ( SVs ) recorded from burials during the sherd rough-sort analysis , 37 were from <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots .
The high percentage of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> SVs suggested either a bias in recognizing <START:ceramic> buffware <END> versus <START:ceramic> plainware <END> reconstructible vessels from mortuary contexts , or the use of partial plain- ware pots ( e .g. , sherd plates ) for mortuary furniture .

Classic period site of Pueblo Grande , Walsh-Anduze ( 1994 :252 ) recorded 137 sherd plates in burials , 70 percent of which w ere from <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots ; these sherd plates were partial vessels that were reused but not reworked .
If such large unworked sherds w ere intentionally placed in the burials at Grewe , and were accounted for by the presence of SVs , the proportion of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> to <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels would be more balanced .
It consisted of a reconstructible <START:ceramic> Sweetwater Red-on-gray <END> neckless ja r with a beaker-like shape , and two decorated SVs , also from the Sweetwater phase ( Figure 5.6 ) .

Com parison of Mortuary and Non ­ mortuary <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> by Caliche Content1 .__ _ _ _
The caliche content in whole <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels from mortuary contexts and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds was very similar ( Table 5.9 ) .
It is possible that the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots included in burials were selected on the basis of a perceived aesthetic superiority in terms of color .
Data considered for the temper comparison included those for both <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds , but again only those from Sacaton and Santa Cruz contexts were considered ( Table 5.12 ) .

In one case , a large <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> ja r was almost entirely burned , inside and out , perhaps suggesting that it had passed through the crematory fire with the body of the deceased .
It appears , however , that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery may have been selected over <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels , although to what extent is unclear .
COMPARISON WITH SNAKETOWN The goal of this analysis was to assess the variability of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessel forms at Grewe with respect to the range of vessel forms recorded at Snaketown ( Haury 1976 ) .
Due both to the conclusive evidence of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production at Snaketown and to the vast extent of the sample size ( Haury 1976 :192 , 194-1 97 ) , the assemblage of vessel forms there is considered a representative sample of variability against which to compare the Grewe assemblage .
Relatively little is known about <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production at Grewe , but a smaller range of vessel forms w ould be expected if the mode of production differed from that at Snaketown or if no production took place there .
Other - - 10 ( 0.8 ) Total <START:ceramic> PLAINWARE <END> 19 16 1,261 Mica Schist 7 15 1,066 ( 100.0)
Data from the detailed rim sherd analysis indicated that there were relatively few <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jar rim sherds in the assemblage , resulting in the expectation that a very limited set of ja r forms was present at Grewe .
Because there is conclusive evidence for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production at Snaketown ( Haury 1976 : 194-1 97 ) , such a similarity between the Grewe and Snake­ town vessel form typologies suggests one of two possible scenarios : either <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery was produced at Grewe , or there was an unrestricted supply flow moving from production centers along the Gila River to Grewe .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ CHAPTER 6 STANDARDIZATION IN <START:ceramic> BUFFWARE <END> PRODUCTION by David R. Abbott How red-on-buff makers were organized is an important topic that pertains to the Hohokam political econom y ( e .g. , Doyel 1981 ) and the socioeconomic network that linked various populations within the Hohokam regional system ( e .g. , Abbott et al . 1997 ) .
Despite this top ic’s significance , few inform ed infer ­ ences concerning <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production have been estab­ lished , although in recent years consensus has been building about some aspects ( see Chapter 7 for other pertinent inform ation on this point ) .
Many theorists now believe , citing a few lines of mostly indirect evidence ( see below ) , that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots were largely made in the Gila River valley .
In addition , Lindauer 's ( 1988 ) w ork with the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery from the Gila Bend area indicates that some amount of the Sedentary period decorated ware was probably manufactured locally in the lower Gila River Valley .
The evidence marshaled to investigate <START:ceramic> buffware <END> produc­ tion has rarely included measures of technological and vessel form standardization1 , which are com monly utilized in archaeological practice ( e .g. , Costin 1991 ) to evaluate the scale , as well as the production’s intensity ( part-time vs. full-tim e artisans ) , concentration ( dispersed vs. nucleated production units ) , and sociopolitical context ( independent vs. producers attached to elites ) .
In this chapter , we attem pt an assessment of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> standardization using both diachronic and cross ­ ware comparisons of several technological attributes of the red-painted pottery and other wares .
Methodological difficulties were encountered along the way , but , hopefully , the lessons learned will invigorate and inform similar enquiries of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production in the Hohokam heartland .
THE EVIDENCE FOR <START:ceramic> BUFFWARE <END> PRODUCTION Brow n paste variants of the red-on-buff types were made in the lower Salt River valley and probably along the Agua Fria R iver with locally available temper types ( Ab­ bott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1988 ; Weed 1972 ) .
The clay frac­ tions in brown paste cases from the Phoenix area were shown to chemically match those in locally produced <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ) .
Nearly all <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery contained some am ount of coarse-grained mica schist ( e .g. , Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; A bbott 1983 , 1988 , 1995b ; Haury 1976 ; Rafferty 1982a ; Wallace 1995 ) , a rock type that was naturally available in the Phoenix Basin only at bedrock units along the Gila River and Queen Creek ( see Chapter 2 ; Schaller 1994 ) .
Further ­ more , unlike some mica schist-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceram ­ ics , none of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specimens is known to contain the “red arkose” fragm ents that typify the Queen Creek pottery ( Antieau 1977 ) .
The temper evidence supports the view that red-on-buff pots were the exclusive products of Gila River potters , although such a conclusion precludes the possibility that raw schist was widely traded as a necessary ingredient for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production to settlements throughout the Hohokam culture area .
Its location , and the presence of <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> sherds to the near exclusion of other decorated types , securely dated the work area to the Seden­ tary period .
A second locus of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production in the Gila River valley was discovered at the M aricopa Road site , some 8 km west of Snaketown on the north side of the river .
However , based on an abundance of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery , which exceeded 40 percent of the total , Lascaux and Ravesloot ( 1993 :43-45 ) suggested that the Maricopa Road site may have been one of a few centers of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production that were clustered in the middle Gila River valley .
Haury ( 1976 :205 ) observed that the poor execution of designs on <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> pots possibly indicated greater concern on the part of the artisans for quantity rather than quality .
Haury’s idea , in conjunction with the unusually high percentage ( 40 percent ) of deco­ rated sherds in the Sacaton phase contexts at Snaketown , led Doyel ( 1980:30 ; 1981 :58 ) to infer that the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery was mass produced by specialists for an exchange market .
Rafferty ( 1982a :211-212 ) and Walsh-Anduze ( 1993b ) reported decorated percentages ( approxim ately 60 percent ) from the Gila Butte site that exceeded those at Snaketown and argued the high concentration was evidence for a large - scale <START:ceramic> buffware <END> industry at the Gila Butte site .
Neitzel ( 1991:185 ) also presented evidence for the specialist production of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery during the Colo­ nial and Sedentary periods .
Her conclusions for an escalated intensity of production ( i .e . , more pots fabricated by each potter ) are supported by the rapid increase of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> percentages during the late Colonial and early Sedentary periods in the ceramic inventories throughout the Hohokam territory ( e .g. , Abbott 1988 ; Doyel 1981 ; Haury 1976 ; L indauer 1993 ; Mitchell and Lane 1989 ) .
Other findings have prom pted some researchers to argue that most , if not all , of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specialists were concen­ trated in a small part of the Gila River valley .
Furtherm ore , when the last visible trace of the footway was projected into the Snaketown settlement , the __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Standardization in <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Production/127 transect passed neatly between the trash mounds in both the peripheral and central portions of the village and within about 15 mof Haury’s pottery-m aking work area .
Mot- singer ( 1993 :72 ) suggested that the trail was a tangible manifestation of an alliance between the two villages for exclusive control over production and distribution of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery ( see also Rafferty 1982b ) .
The alliance hypothesis seems unlikely because several sources of coarse-grained mica schist other than the mines at Gila Butte were available in the G ila River valley ( see Chapter 2 ) , and most of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels from that region , including those at Grewe ( see Chapter 4) , were also tempered with abundant am ounts of the crushed schist .
A somewhat contrary position on <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production has been argued by Lindauer ( 1 988 ) .
The variability was greater than that typically found among ethnographically produced ceramics , leading him to conclude that evidence of special­ ized production was not present in his <START:ceramic> buffware <END> database .
Several m echanical variables were gauged to study <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
They included two metric variables recorded from rim sherds and several technological vari­ ables pertaining specifically to <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramics .
Caliche chunks appear as chalk white , somewhat lustrous , homogeneous , and often granular masses in a freshly broken cross section of a <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherd .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Standardization in <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Production/129 Methodological Concerns Im plem enting the standardization concept to study the organization of pottery production requires comparison .
Beginning with the jars , it was noted that the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots largely com plem ented the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> forms in aperture size in all of the temporal contexts .If we accept the significance of aperture size as one indicator of vessel function , then we can presume that the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jars were used differently from many of the undecorated forms .
Moreover , the greater diversity in the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> aperture diameters , in contrast to the narrow range for the decorated jars , probably corresponded to a greater number of functional classes for the former .
Consequently , we would be ill advised to draw conclusions about standardization of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> jars by contrasting them with plainw are examples .
When we broke dow n those modal classes by ware , we found the different w ares ’ contributions to each class had shifted over time , perhaps indicating some changes in how <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls were used relative to one another .
Nevertheless , we found that both <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels substan­ tively contributed to all or most of the size classes in each temporal set ( Table 6.1 ) .
Because rim sherds from <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls were relatively com mon at Grewe during the Snake- town through the Sacaton phase , it was possible to compare the bowls of the different red-on-buff types to one another , as well as to their coeval <START:ceramic> plainware <END> counterparts .
A second concern for the analyses of the upper wall thickness variables was the widely dissim ilar <START:ceramic> buffware <END> rim forms .
For this reason , the size classes of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls were further subdivided according to rim angle : flared versus straight and outcurved .
We wished to know if <START:ceramic> buffware <END> versus contem porary <START:ceramic> plainware <END> containers and <START:ceramic> late buffware <END> versus earlier <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots , were more standardized , thereby suggesting different levels of specialization in the mode of their production .
Let us assume that the inhabitants at each village in the middle Gila River valley relied exclusively on four local potters in their village for their <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots .
If there were 25 villages , then there would have been 100 <START:ceramic> plainware <END> potters in the valley overall .
Let us also assume that the same pottery consumers obtained decorated containers as well , but each of their <START:ceramic> buffware <END> inventories cam e from all 20 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specialists , who were scattered across the valley .If we assume that the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 130/Chapter 6 Table 6.1 .

were in equal am ounts at Grewe and everywhere else , then the ratio of plainw are producers to products for the hypo­ thetical analysis of the pottery at each site would be five tim es sm aller than for the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ratio .
This result would be exactly the reverse for the region as a whole , where the ratio of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> producers to products would be five times greater than the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ratio .
In this hypothetical example , we might hope that the great intensity of production activities on the part o feach of the 20 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> makers would have created more standard ­ ized products relative to the less intensive w ork of each of the 100 plainw are potters .
We can see , nonetheless , how the 20 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> suppliers represented at Grewe (versus four <START:ceramic> plainware <END> potters ) might im part a degree of variation that would mask the product uniform ity created by each skillful and hardworking <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacturer .
Nevertheless , several <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sources that produced mica schist-tem ­ pered pottery were possibly represented in the comparative samples despite these efforts .If the m ultiple analytical groups differentiated by the chemical assays were any indicator , then the production output from m ultiple buff ­ ware sources was probably included as well .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Standardization in <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Production/131 Average Thickness A procedure for appraising the equality of the variances between two assem blages was used in conjunction with the average thickness variable .
For the comparison of different bow l sets ( e.g. , to compare the straight-rim med <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> bowls with the com bined sizes of Sacaton phase straight-rim med plain- ware bowls ) , a regression analysis for each set was sepa­ rately com pleted and the residuals extracted .
Buffware Technological Variables Finally , we were interested in the distribution of the ceramic samples across the various categories of several <START:ceramic> buffware <END> technological variables , including caliche content , paste color , surface color , paint quality , and mica density .
K intigh’s ( 1992 ) com puterized software was used for comparing the Grewe <START:ceramic> buffware <END> assemblages .
Coeval sets of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and plainw are bowls w ere exam ­ ined for differences in variation , as were pairs of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sets from different temporal phases .
If true , there was an absence of notable differences in the scale and mode of production for the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls during m uch of the Hohokam sequence .
Neither did <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production change significantly over time .
For instance , Sacaton R ed-on-buff bowls from the medium -sized class , with straight rims , and deep wall angles ( n = 6 ) were compared to straight-rim med , deep - walled , m edium -sized <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls with mica schist temper from the Sacaton phase ( n=11 ) .
The <START:ceramic> buffware <END> containers had a considerably smaller average variation ( Zj=.525 )
suggesting that the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> set was more standardized than the corresponding <START:ceramic> plainware <END> set .
In contrast , heterogeneous , ghost , and faint paint were noted elsewhere with considerable fre ­ quency on late Sacaton R ed-on-buff bowls and jars and __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Standardization in <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Production/133 Table 6.2.

Casa Grande R ed-on-buff jars ( Abbott , ed . , 1994:Table 6.63 ) , perhaps indicating that less standardization and a reduction in the quality of hem atite paints were associated with the decline of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> tradition beginning in the late part of the Sedentary period .
The counts in Table 6.6 indicate that fewer dark surface colors were present in the three later sets , probably reflecting better and more consistent control over firing conditions by <START:ceramic> buffware <END> makers by the end of the Pioneer period ( see Chapter 7 ) .
Her hypothesis of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specialists at that time is modestly supported by our technological results .
A challenge for future <START:ceramic> buffware <END> standardization studies will be to identify appropriate metric m easures ( presum ably of rim sherds ) that can be profitably applied .
Finally , a huge advancem ent in the study of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production can be expected with better production source inform ation .
Our diachronic comparisons of the red-on-buff sets , as well as our contrasts betw een the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery , probably included decorated sherds from several , and possibly many , groups of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> artisans in the Gila River valley .
Once ceramics can be separated according __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Standardization in <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Production/139 to source with clay and temper data , then the metric and technological variation associated with specific potter com m unities will be subject to appraisal .
We may anticipate the em ergence at that time of a richly detailed and precise assessm ent of Hohokam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
Our findings contribute some new observations for understanding the process , scale , and location of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS FOR BUFFWARE MANUFACTURE The process , scale , and location of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production are controversial subjects .
Based on a thin section analysis of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds from the Salt River valley , Wei sm an ( 1987:31 ) maintained that , “buffware ceramics were not necessarily the product of a unique type of clay .
This simple idea has broad implications for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production because it supposes that a geographically distinct bu ff clay source was not necessary to make red-on-buff pots .
Weisman ( 1987:32 ) apparently applied this test to his thin sections and found no evidence of a slip or wash on Colonial and Sedentary period <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds .
Test Tiles Before addressing the validity of Wei sm an’s <START:ceramic> buffware <END> model , we present some experim ental results involving the firing of test tiles prepared from various clays .
Other samples included three small clay lumps from Grewe that may have been used by potters , although the microprobe data indicated that they were chemically dissim ilar from the clay fraction in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery at Grewe ( see Chapter 3 ) .
Some of the sediments excavated from the settling basins w ere shown to chemically match the phyllite-tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery that was made at Las Colinas ( Crown et al . 1988 ) .
In order to duplicate the size of the caliche inclusions found in Hoho- kam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , a sample of Sacaton R ed-on-buff sherds with __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Specialized Studies and Observations on Pottery Production/143 Table 7.1 .
Although this material has generally been assum ed to be <START:ceramic> buffware <END> clay , never before had it been fired to test that assumption .
Similarly low calcium levels were m easured in the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery assayed for this project ( Table E.2 ) . Presumably , the other brown-firing clays from the Phoenix sources had low calcium am ounts also .
Conse­ quently , maxim um firing temperatures above 800o C probably were necessary to produce a bleaching effect and the lighter shades of Hohokam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .
Third , of the two clays , only the change in the buff - colored material m im icked the shade and uniform ity of color found in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .
Weisman ( 1987:33 ) reported problem s with producing <START:ceramic> buffware <END> replicas from the alluvial clay he procured from the prehistoric canal near La Ciudad .
Weisman concluded that an even and fine-grained distribution of calcium interspersed through the ceramic paste was essen­ tial for making <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .
If , as we suspect , Wei sm an’s alluvial clay had only a low natural amount of the bleaching agent , then it would be difficult to replicate Hohokam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery from it when relying solely on caliche additives to increase the calcium content .
Tem poral Change Our data confirm ed the widely accepted inference that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> surface color changed over time .
When the two lightest colors ( white and yellow-white ) were combined , there was a temporally progressive increase in the percent ­ age of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds with the lightest casts .
First , the ceramic analysts recorded the presence of caliche nodules during the detailed analysis in all but 2.1 percent of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery ( i .e . , Snake- town R ed-on-buff through Casa Grande R ed-on-buff in Table 7.3 ) .
Notes : includes white and yellow-white ; 2includes light brown , gray brown , gray , and orange ; 3excludes <START:ceramic> grayware <END> ; 4not included in the temporal trend ; ( ) = percent of row total . __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
that were sprinkled with major amounts of caliche nodules were either Sacaton or <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> .
Third , the size of the caliche nodules was not m easured systematically , but their large dimensions led petrographer Elizabeth Miksa to state that they probably were not natural inclusions in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> clay ( see Chapter 2 ) .
The processed clay lump belied that idea and instead supported the inference that m ixing caliche nodules into the paste was an integral step in the process of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
In contrast to the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery , caliche nodules were absent from 30 percent of the sherds classified as unidenti­ fied <START:ceramic> grayware <END> and probably dated to the Pioneer period ( see Table 7.3 ) .
This difference in caliche content between <START:ceramic> buffware <END> and <START:ceramic> grayware <END> ceramics lends support to Weis - man’s proposal for a shift in paste type during the Pioneer period .
As discussed below , the percentage of <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-gray <END> that contained no caliche was 17.3 percent , slightly more than those Snaketown R ed-on-buff sherds lacking the white nodules ( 9.0 percent ) but considerably less than the 30 percent of the other ( and probably mostly pre-Snaketown phase ) Pioneer period <START:ceramic> grayware <END> .
Below , we return to the distinctions betw een the gray and b u ff varieties of the Snaketown type because they offer additional clues about <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production and the timing of the developm ental changes .

Salt In support of Wei sm an’s model , there were also two lines of evidence to indicate that salt was an intentional ingredient in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacture .
For the microprobe analyses , 70 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds from three Gila River sites and the 15 buff-firing test tiles were chemically characterized .
Indeed , the chemical data from several test tiles were quite distinct from the clay fraction in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds ( see Chapter 3 ) .
It was instructive , although obviously not conclusive , that the buff-firing raw clays all contained more iron ( Fe ) and less sodium ( Na ) than most of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds ( Table 7.4 ; see also Table E.2 ) .
We should expect , therefore , that the addition of salt to a ceramic paste would increase the concentration of Na and low er that of Fe , as we observed in the comparison between the test tiles and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds .
Also , the concen­ trations of Na in the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds assayed with the microprobe were considerably lower than those m easured in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds , but they were about the same as in the buff-colored test tiles ( see Table E.2 ) .
But , in addition , we agree with Haury in suspecting that a mastery over firing temperature and atm osphere was a crucial advancem ent in the developm ent of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
Snaketown R ed-on-buff and six <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-gray <END> sherds .
By definition , the surface colors of the two sets were distinct prior to reheating ( <START:ceramic> grayware <END> : 3 gray , 3 gray-brown ; <START:ceramic> buffware <END> : 3 light brown , 2 orange ) , although their range of paste colors overlapped greatly ( <START:ceramic> grayware <END> : 3 gray , 1 brown , 1light brown , 1 orange-pink ; <START:ceramic> buffware <END> : 1 brown , 2 light brown , 2 orange-pink ).2
Each <START:ceramic> grayware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherd was broken into two pieces , and one part from each sherd was refired in an electric kiln for 30 minutes at 800o C in an oxidizing atm osphere .
None of the surface colors of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds changed at all , indicating rough equivalencies between the modern and ancient firing temperatures and atmospheres .
The paste colors of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds all turned to orange-pink , however , probably indicating that the electric kiln was held at the maxim um temperature longer than had happened prehistorically .
Rem arkably , the surface colors of the <START:ceramic> grayware <END> sherds all turned light brown , matching three of the five <START:ceramic> buffware <END> cases .
Four of the six <START:ceramic> grayware <END> pieces also had cross sections that turned orange-pink , identical to those from their <START:ceramic> buffware <END> counterparts .
The other two <START:ceramic> grayware <END> paste colors refired to light brown .
From these results we concluded that the distinction between Hohokam <START:ceramic> grayware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery may be due as m uch to firing conditions as to the com positional variability described in Wei sm an’s model .
Success in firing re ­ mained erratic , however , resulting in num erous <START:ceramic> grayware <END> products .
Finally , the yellow reaction rims around caliche form between 800o and 1000° C ( Rye 1976 :134) , further indicating that tempera­ tures in that range were attained when <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots were fired .
We belabor the point on firing temperature because controls over temperature and atmosphere were essential for producing <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery , and understanding how the Hohokam potters achieved those controls is im portant for modeling <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacture .
Finally , shielding <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery with insulation materials would keep fuel wood from contacting the pots and avoid carbon blemishes .
In these ways , too , the pit and sherd-cover technique may have been the best method for firing <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots .
At Snaketown , in the pottery workshop area , Haury ( 1976 :197 ) found several pottery-firing pits that were filled with ash , mesquite charcoal , and num erous large <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds that had been repeatedly burned .
He concluded that the large sherds w ere used to “shingle ” the load of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots during the baking process .
The Snaketown evidence dem onstrated that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> potters had discovered the utility of the pit and sherd-cover technique by the Sacaton phase .
If correct , then the adoption of pit and sherd-cover firing during that time may have also been a crucial step forward for the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> craft .
Instead , the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> tradition probably developed along a contin­ uum of progress that involved several innovations .
First , Wei sm an had problems with replicating <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .
We question if it is possible to make <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery in the manner that Hohokam artisans did ( i .e . , adding caliche ) when starting with a brown-firing ( calcium -poor ) clay .
Second , the buff-firing calcareous clays necessary for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacture may not have been as widely avail­ able as im plied in Wei sm an’s model .
Consequently , the basic ingredients of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery — buff-firing clay and mica schist temper —were closely associated with the Gila River valley .
Fortunately , the petrographic and chemical methods described in Chapters 2 and 3 , once applied to <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specimens from across the Hohokam territory , may provide the definitive evidence we seek in order to determine , finally and unequivocally , the production sources of the red ­ on-buff ceramics .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Specialized Studies and Observations on Pottery Production/149 In the rem ainder of this chapter , we shift our discussion from <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production alone to a consideration of whether pottery of any ware or type was made at Grewe .
As noted in the previous chapters , the vast majority of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and redw are ceramics was tempered with coarse-grained mica schist .
A t the Tucson Basin sites , however , the micaceous gneiss was not added to the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> bowls and jars , being reserved for decorated wares ( W illiam Doelle , personal com munication , 1999 ) .

CONCLUSIONS Our results have added some new insights about the process of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production and how that process m ight have developed or changed over time .
Inspired by Weis - man’s ( 1987 ) innovative work , we gathered relevant inform ation during the ceramic detailed analysis and from experiments designed to test some of Wei sm an’s ideas about <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production .
We agreed with Wei sm an that during the Pioneer period , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> artisans began using calcareous alluvial clays that were chemically manipulated for workability and bleaching .
Also , our experimental results led us to tentatively disagree with Wei sm an’s idea that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots could have been routinely made across the Hohokam territory by adding caliche and salt to most alluvial clays .
Instead , we hypothesized that the recipe for Hohokam <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery began with calcareous , buff-firing clays .
Caliche and possibly salt were added for bleaching the ceramic fabric , but this method was not sufficient to produce the light - colored <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots when starting with a brown-firing , calcium -poor clay .
In contrast , to suggest that redware and espe­ cially <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pots were sim ilarly produced would have been quickly dism issed as pure fantasy .
In the last few years , however , strong evidence for specialist production of Classic period redware ( Abbott , ed . , 1994 ; Abbott 1994c ; Abbott and Walsh-Anduze 1995 ; Heidke and Stark 1995 ) and Sedentary period <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery ( Abbott 1998b ; Heidke and Stark 1995 ; Van Keuren et al . 1997 ) have come to the fore , thereby increasing the likelihood that those thousands of pots at Grewe were made elsewhere and transported to the site .
NOTES 1One likely exception may be a subset of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery in the Gila Bend area that may have been locally made ( see Lindauer 1988 ) .
<START:ceramic> Plainware <END> , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , and redware sherds were in­ cluded in the assem blage ( Table 8.2 ) .
The single <START:ceramic> red-slipped <END> perforated disk was fashioned from a Classic period red ­ ware sherd at the Horvath site .
A comparison with the sherds from the rough-sort analysis ( see Chapter 1 ) revealed a higher ratio of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> to other sherd w horls than <START:ceramic> buffware <END> to other sherds in the whole ceramic assemblage , possibly suggesting a preference among the makers of these objects ( Table 8.3 ) .
For in ­ stance , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery typically contains a relatively small proportion of temper in the paste that may have facilitated the shaping and drilling of the sherd disk .

O f these , five cases were <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and one was <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> .
It was made with clay of a <START:ceramic> plainware <END> paste , and exhibited faint traces of pigm ent .
A Clay Palette The rim sherd of a <START:ceramic> plainware <END> clay palette ( specimen 14231 ) tempered with mica schist was also present ( Figure 8.5 ) .
The first ( specimen 8054 ) was a curved , roughly cylindrical <START:ceramic> buffware <END> piece 6 cm long that was broken at one end and pointed at the other .
The second object ( specim en 3583 ) , of mica schist- tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , was a small bent coil piece broken at one end that appeared to have been attached to a flat or nearly flat surface .
The buff category corresponded to the color of a <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessel ( M unsell color range from 7.5YR 8/2-6/4 to 5YR 8/4-6/6 ) .
Brown was sim ilar to the color of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> vessels .
It had a paste sim ilar to that of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels and traces of red paint ; the back of the head was smooth and concave .
It was made of a <START:ceramic> buffware <END> clay and was possibly a fragm ent of an animal effigy vessel .
The first was to produce a fine-scale time seriation of Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> painted pottery for the Snaketown to Soho phase portions of the Hohokam cultural sequence .
MIDDLE GILA <START:ceramic> BUFFWARE <END> : BACKGROUND This study focuses on a particular developm ental series of painted pottery referred to here as Middle G ila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> and known to many archaeologists as Phoenix Basin <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> or Hohokam <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> ( as originally named by Colton and Hargrave 1937 ) .
Some researchers ( Robert Heckman , personalcommuni- cation 1998 ; Stephanie Whittlesey , personal communication 1998 ) suggest that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery identical to that p ro ­ duced at villages along the middle Gila was also manufac­ tured in the Tucson area .
In other areas where “replicas ” of Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> were produced , such as the lower San Pedro valley , Safford valley , and G ila Bend area , both technological and stylistic characteristics clearly separate them from the middle Gila river material .
Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> pottery was produced at settle­ ments in the middle Gila valley , including Snaketown and Gila Butte , in increasing frequencies over time up to some point in the early to m id-Sacaton phase , when frequencies at investigated sites declined .
A dditional analysts who have considered particular details of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence include Antieau ( 1981 ) , Cable et al . ( 1988 ) , Clarke ( 1935 ) , Fast and Caywood ( 1936) , Gregonis ( 1993 ) , Hawley ( 1930 ) , Henderson ( 1987b ) , Lascaux ( 1993 ) , Lindauer ( 1988 ) ; Masse ( 1982 ) , Mitchell and Lane ( 1989 , 1990 ) , Schmidt ( 1928 ) , Walsh and Marty- nec ( 1993 ) , Zaslow ( 1980 , 1984 ) , and no doubt some others who have been overlooked here .
The Middle Gila Sequence : Goals and Development Underlying the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> ceramic sequence are two fundamental guidelines for its developm ent : that time sequencing was its primary goal , and that it should be modified and refined as new data are made available .
This unilinear model of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramic development was the foundation for the Hohokam phase sequence , and a one-to - one correspondence of decorated ceramic types and phases was developed for the Estrella through Sacaton portion of the Hohokam cultural chronology .
The sequence was __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/179 founded on excavations in short-lived sites or site areas , on extensive stratigraphic testing , ceramic cross dating , and several sets of independent dates ( Gladwin and Gladwin 1929 , 1933 ; Gladwin et al . 1937 ; Haury 1932 , 1937a , 1937b , 1945 , 1976 ) .
The ceramic type descriptions for the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> series were developed and modified as new data becam e available .
The added burden of alterations in chrono­ logical sequences due to typological changes must also be considered in the case of the monolithic <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence .
Chronologically founded typological sequences , such as the one proposed by Haury for the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> are models of stylistic and technological developm ent to be tested and refined con­ stantly .
Project Goals , Assumptions , and Approach The primary goal of this study was to refine the Snake- town to Soho phase Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> ceramic se­ quence to provide greater temporal control , and to do so in amanner that can be replicated and easily applied by other researchers .
Potentially time sensitive variables were analyzed on Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> pottery in the selected contexts , a num erical seriation was conducted and compared with independent dating and sequencing information , and the results were utilized to develop a refined stylistic and technological sequence and to establish refined ceramic types .
The approach to ceramic sequence refinem ent taken here is drawn from and founded on Haury’s ( 1937a , 1945 , 1976 ) <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramic sequence .
It is assumed that the general typological sequence from <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-buff <END> through Casa Grande R ed-on-buff is valid at the type/phase level .
With this framework already in place , it is __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 180/Chapter 10 reasonable to analyze contexts that are not stratigraphically interrelated , and to evaluate their significance in elucidating the sequence of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> stylistic and technological devel­ opment .
The Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> sequence is in need of refinem ent for several reasons .
First , the time spans repre ­ sented by portions of the existing <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence are too long to be useful for many of the detailed research questions asked in current archaeological investigations .
There have been two studies that applied m ultidim en­ sional scaling analyses to <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery in an attempt to develop site sequences .
To be fair , both of these studies were strong first attempts at fine ­ scale seriation of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> despite methodological flaws .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/181 Discussion The Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> ceramic sequence was defined with time sequencing as its primary goal .
The results obtained are viewed as a model of the stylistic sequence of Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> that requires additional testing and refinement .
Context of Analysis Identification and Selection The time seriation presented in this study depended on the careful selection of archaeological units or contexts containing suitable collections of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery that could be analyzed .
Contexts ultimately selected for inclusion in the analysis are listed and described in Table 10.1 , and Table 10.2 summarizes general data concerning the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery within the contexts .
A ll contexts containing sherds mixed in from a non ­ adjacent phase at a level greater than 7 percent were __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/183 Table 10.1 .

__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/187 excluded from consideration .
For example , if a context contained mainly <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> sherds but also contained more than 7 percent of Gila Butte or earlier sherds , the context would be discarded .
The author began by creating a tabulated listing of the ceramic size and type data for each feature’s stratum and level that contained 20 o r more <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds identified at the type level or the level of one of two types , and that contained 15 percent or more <START:ceramic> plainware <END> sherds larger than 9 cm2 .
Therefore , some predom inately Gila Butte contexts marked through the rough sort analysis as being more than 7 percent mixed with <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> were also considered possible candidates for inclusion in the analysis subject to inspection by the author .
Cases with more than 15 or 20 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels ( that are not miniatures or specialized forms ) are extremely rare ( only one case is known to the author ) .
The greater the so - cial/spatial distance between potters or potting communities , the more likely are differences in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> design and technology .
At least one study has claimed to identify production source variability in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> .
In her study of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> recovered from sites along the Salt-Gila Aqueduct , Crown ( 1984 ) compared design attributes on sites in the Queen Creek and Gila River areas , lumping the collections by identified phase .
T o limit the potential __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 188/Chapter 10 for production source variability as much as possible , only <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds containing coarse-grained muscovite schist were included in this analysis .
The model identified modal traits for each <START:ceramic> buffware <END> type in the sequence as well as the manner in which defining traits were expected to behave at phase boundaries .
For example , careless , shallow incising was viewed as characteristic of <START:ceramic> Gila Butte Red-on-buff <END> , and the point at which incising ceased to be applied ( and the vessels discarded ) marked the end of <START:ceramic> Gila Butte Red-on-buff <END> and the beginning of Santa Cruz Red-on-buff .
An im portant feature of the Haury/G ladwin model of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> stylistic development is that , even though we may not know the pace of development or how the pace may have changed , all lines of evidence point to continuity .
Consider these two examples illustrating the manner in which descriptive and defining traits function in the model : sectioned layouts with line-demar- cated panels are a descriptive trait that appeared for the first time in the sequence on <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> .
Knowing this , we can infer that somewhere between the time Sacaton was first produced and the terminus of the phase , there was an __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/189 Table 10.3 .
Furthermore , because sectioned layouts with panels were also com monplace on <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> , it can be assumed that the frequency of this trait did not significantly decline before <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> was no longer produced .
For cunei­ form hatch , a defining trait for <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> , the typological model assumes a frequency curve within the time span of the type .
The author applied his experience gained from previous work with <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery .
Most variables selected will be at least generally familiar to researchers acquainted with Phoenix Basin <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ; but the specific ways in which they are defined often differ from previous approaches .
The reader should not assume that just because a trait has a fam iliar name , it is the same as what they are familiar with , because term inology has not been consistently applied in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramic studies .
To facilitate the recording of this variable , the author com piled a catalog of all of the published photographs and drawings of Phoenix Basin <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels as of November 1996 .
Data Recording Procedures Data recording for the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> seriation took place in two phases between Novem ber of 1996 and M arch of 1998 .

Relative to the quantities of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery present on sites in the Phoenix Basin , the sample of sherds included in this analysis is small , and it is reasonable to question whether the samples are adequate for the goals of the study .
The 11-part division of the Snaketown to Soho sequence of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> stylistic developm ent is the basis for the second portion of this report .
TYPOLOGICAL REFINEM ENT This section uses the results of the time seriation of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery from the Snaketown through the Soho phases to refine the typological sequence .

The following are provisional definitions and partial descriptions at the finest level of temporal resolution currently feasible from the available data for the post- Sweetwater <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence .
The provisional descriptions presented below document the variability and defining characteristics of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> present in each analyzed segment of the time seriation .
As was the case with Haury’s typology , the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence was seriated and subdivided into defined segments , with all but one of the segments ultim ately considered here to be ceramic types .
Haury ( 1976 :214-216 ) viewed the incising on <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-buff <END> as changing over the course of __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/223 the phase , becoming shallower and less precisely spaced .
Two of the incised sherds from this tim e segment with clear Snaketown style hachure-filled designs bore the sloppy , shallow incising most ceramicists would consider diagnostic of <START:ceramic> Gila Butte Red-on-buff <END> .
The style first appeared on what Haury ( 1937a :192-198 , 1976 : 217-219 ) defined as <START:ceramic> Sweetwater Red-on-gray <END> and continued into Late Snaketown .
The frequencies of full exterior bowl designs were on the decline from the preceding Sweetwater phase , based on Haury’s description of <START:ceramic> Sweetwater Red-on-gray <END> ( Haury 1976 :219 ; see also 1937a :225 , Fig . 111 ) .
Ceramic Types : Late <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-buff <END> , Late Snaketown R ed-on-gray With the Late Snaketown time segment come the earliest ceramic types that can be defined in the analyzed data set .
This drop may correlate with __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/225 the addition of a surface coating to 25 percent of the vessels , adramatic increase from that seen in the earlier Snaketown phase contexts .
In so doing , we avoid the awkward term inological issue faced by Haury’s original single type , <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-buff <END> , which incorporated gray paste vessels with no surface coating .
The Late Snaketown time segment represents what may be the shortest identifiable span of stylistic change in the entire <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence .
There is no other tim e in the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> stylistic sequence when such a clear transition , visible on individual vessels , links two different design schemes .
Surface __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Sériation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila Bujfware SequenceHH coated vessels are defined as Early <START:ceramic> Gila Butte Red-on-buff <END> ; their uncoated , fire-clouded companion vessels are classified as Early Gila Butte Red-on-gray .
The author previously proposed the existence of a stylistic time segment similar to Early Gila Butte on the basis of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> collection from the Hedge Apple site in the Tonto Basin ( W allace 1995 ) .
The only ceramic type defined for the Late Gila Butte time segment is a <START:ceramic> buffware <END> , because all but one of the vessels recorded had a surface coating and/or apink ( or partially pink-colored ) paste .
Differences are also seen in his analysis of the pottery from Pit 6:8E ( Haury 1976 :214 ) , which he suggests is "typologically closer to <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> than to <START:ceramic> Snaketown Red-on-buff <END> . "
<START:ceramic> Buffware <END> firing and surface coating technol­ ogy neared the culm ination of the trend begun in the Snaketown time segment : virtually all vessels were surface coated ( 93 percent ) , and only 15 percent bore evidence of fire clouding .
This contrasts with the dull " thud " of the <START:ceramic> grayware <END> pottery of earlier times .
Haury illustrated panel layouts for <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> ( Haury 1976 :211 , Fig . 12.28b , c , d ) , but no such vessels were documented in the analyzed collections .
Even though four incised sherds w ere present in the ana­ lyzed collection , incising is thought to be diagnostic of the pre-Santa Cruz portion of the sequence ; incising is not included here in the definition of <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> .
Percentages of rims with rim lines ranged from 90 to 100 percent from this point on to the end of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence .
The horizon marker for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery from this point forward is the presence of a fully painted rim line .
The trend is reversed for sectioned layouts : In Early Saca ­ ton , sectioned layouts were much more common on bowls ( 54.1 percent ) than on jars ( 23.8 percent ) , whereas in __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/237 Early/Middle Early Sacaton Sacaton Middle Sacaton 1 Late Sacaton Table 10.16 .

The Los Morteros feature was included as the only context in the seriation where it was believed that the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> was a long-distance import .
Overall , jars were becoming more and more abundant in the __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 240/Chapter 10 <START:ceramic> buffware <END> assemblage at the expense of bowls : 62 versus 38 percent .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/241 Key Traits .
Many jars are very large and represent some ofthe largest <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels everrecorded .
As several of the illustrated vessels are quite spectacular , and because they compose the majority of the elaborately decorated vessels illustrated by Haury in the 1937 report , they have becom e synonymous with <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> to many archaeologists .
Wavy-capped fringes appear to have been __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/243 restricted in the time sequence to Middle Sacaton 2 and Late Sacaton when used as panel centerlines and panel borders .
Other motifs thought to be significant in Middle Sacaton 2are those that usher in the increasingly stylized and sim plified designs that led to <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> .
In contrast , a set of vessels bore strongly rectilinear designs in a style similar to what Zaslow ( 1984 ) viewed as late in the evolu­ tion of <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> .
There is a __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/245 chance that the analyzed context contains a mixture of material late in Sacaton and material dating to Middle Sacaton 2. A dditional contexts will need to be examined to evaluate this possibility .
Another problem is the low frequency of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> in contexts postdating Middle Sacaton 2. Most work up to now has focused on the Salt River valley .
Higher frequencies are anticipated in portions of the middle Gila valley due to the production centers in that area and apparent ongoing reduction in the spatial scale of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> exchange systems .
The Soho phase data provide important inform ation on the terminus of the prehistoric <START:ceramic> buffware <END> decorative sequence .
With these goals in mind , there was no intent to provide a detailed type description for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> dating to the Soho phase nor to evaluate possible stylistic trends over the span of the phase .
There are excellent descrip ­ tions of <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> , the ceramic type associ­ ated with the Soho phase , in the literature that need not be recounted here ( see Doyel 1974 :52-54 , 71-74 ; Haury 1945 :51-62 , 1976 :202-203 ) .
Numbers o f __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/247 measurable sherds included in the analysis for the two contexts are 27 and 51 , respectively , for a total of 78 sherds .
The Sidewinder Ruin collection of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> body sherds ( along with a few rims ) had been separated into alarge box in the ASM collections ( sherds were in a single large pile and not bagged by feature ) .
The analyzed collections for the Soho tim e segment included the common ja r forms documented by other researchers for <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> .
Pitchers may postdate the introduction of tall ja r necks in the Soho time segment , given that they are limited to post-A.D. 1300 contexts in the Tucson area ; however , there are no data to pinpoint their introduction into the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence .
The few cases recorded here were insufficient for generalization ; however , one can argue on the basis of published descriptions of <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> , that they are most often found in voids within small solids adjacent to the upper or lower design framing lines , or on ja r necks ( the " solid void motif" ) .
A significant percentage of the space on <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> design layouts was devoted to filler spaces and a corresponding need for filler motifs .
__ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/249 Most Casa Grande vessels were coded as having rectilin ­ ear designs (91 percent ) .
Many researchers rely on paste density , paint quality , and surface appearance to identify <START:ceramic> Casa Grande Red-on-buff <END> in sherd collections .
Subdivided sectioned layouts with uniform line widths and a lack of large solids and fringes transform <START:ceramic> buffware <END> design into something that appears formalized and rigid in expression .
One explana­ tion that would fit current perspectives is that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery switched from a relatively centralized production system that involved extensive intercommunity exchange , to a system that was more fragmented and m ulticentric .
Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> , though often bearing relatively simple designs , was painted and produced with a rich and diverse assortment of decoration and form , and its analysis is a complex and dem anding task .

Some portions of the sequence are __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/253 more readily identified than others , because the traits involved are more common , or easier to measure or see than those of other time segments .
Any design can be truncated on a vessel fragment , and the more one knows of the range of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> design , the easier it is to evaluate what one is seeing .
Learning <START:ceramic> buffware <END> design layouts and how to identify them from sherds can be made sim pler in several ways .
Contrary to what one might at first suspect when faced with a bewildering array of decorated sherds , Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> is relatively standardized in its adherence to particular design themes , layouts , and combinations of motifs .
The differ ­ ences are most pronounced for our respective identifications of <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> .
First , some researchers have assumed that all Gila Butte vessels are incised , assigning all unincised sherds with Colonial period designs to <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> ( e .g .
With the benefit of hindsight gained from this investigation , it can be seen that the collections of Gila Butte and <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> housed at ASM , largely com posed of sherds from Snake- town , have contributed to the confusion , because many sherds in the Santa Cruz collection would be classified as Early Gila Butte or Late Gila Butte based on trailing line spacing .

Comparison of Ceramic Type Identifications from Independent Analyses by David Abbott and Henry Wallace of <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Pottery from the Grewe , Las Colinas , Siphon Draw , and Gopherette Sites Included in This Investigation1 .
Haury listed trailing lines on bowl exteriors in the original type description for <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> ( 1937a :183 ) , but did not discuss their absence in the type description of <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> .
However , Fig . 111 ( Haury 1937a :225 ) shows trailing lines becoming widely spaced and fewer on <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> relative to Gila Butte Red-on-buff , and the com plete lack of trailing lines on <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> ; the implication being that they __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ 256/Chapter 10 had vanished before the inception of <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> .
Indeed , some illustrated bowls classified as <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> by Haury ( 1937a:Pl .
Because trailing lines are only one of many traits used in ceramic identification , if they did continue into Sacaton to the point when plaited layouts began to become popular ( as seen in this study ) , then selectively labeling the trailing line vessels as Santa Cruz will violate the time definition goal of the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence .
In the analyzed sample , these __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/257 motifs were recorded in Santa Cruz , Early Sacaton , Middle Sacaton 1 , and Late Sacaton contexts , and they are known to occur from Late Gila Butte to Soho .
The material was viewed as dating to the terminus of the Sacaton phase , and was described as being intermediate in style between <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> and Casa Grande R ed ­ on-buff .
This study was extremely important in the history of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> investigations because it offered the first concrete evidence of a continuous stylistic sequence from the Sedentary to the Classic periods .
A bbott concluded in the Las Colinas study that <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> continued to be produced as late as A.D. 1250 , long past previous estimates , and he reported only very gradual temporal trends in attributes thought to be time sensitive .
LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT It must be em phasized that what has been presented in this study is a model of the post-Sweetwater Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> decorated ceramic sequence , and the types as enum erated here are provisional classifications .
A BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF STYLE AND THE PACE OF STYLISTIC CHANGE With increased understanding of the specific sequence of stylistic developm ent in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery comes greater insight into its potential meaning and significance .
Style 3 lasted 300 years until it was overshadowed by <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> .
Whether this __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/259 represents conservatism on the part of particular potters or potting villages , or whether there was simply a dem and for both styles is unknown .
They also indicate that fine-scale time seriation cannot be perform ed for the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sequence based on style alone .
The style was distributed to these regions on pottery , but only during Middle Sacaton 1 and Middle Sacaton 2. This is based on the latest styles observed by the author on <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery found in these regions .
CONCLUSIONS This study presents a tim e seriation of Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> pottery for the Snaketown through Casa Grande portion of the ceramic sequence .
Significant refinem ents are proposed for Snaketown , Gila Butte , and <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> , and type definitions are clarified for all portions of the investigated sequence to facilitate replicability .
Always a professional , his impeccable research , tremendous insight into the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramic sequence , and willingness to respond to the questions of an eager student were an inspiration .
I thank Arthur Yokes , Jan Bell , and Elaine Hughes at the ASM and Marcia __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ Time Seriation and Typological Refinement of the Middle Gila <START:ceramic> Buffware <END> Sequence/261 Donaldson at the CAP in this regard .
Both <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery from late Colonial , Seden­ tary , and Classic period contexts were especially likely to include sand in addition to the crushed schist .
The assays were centered on Sedentary period ceramics , and considerable variation among both the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery was noted , implying m ultiple production sources .
O f some im por­ tance , the other half of the Sacaton phase <START:ceramic> plainware <END> proved to be chemically dissim ilar from the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> cases at several other G ila River villages .
The distinctiveness of these Grewe ceramics is what we would expect if <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery was made at Grewe in some quantity during the Sacaton phase .
Consequently , the apparent restriction to the G ila River area of the key ingredients for fabricating <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery ( i .e . , buff-firing clays and mica schist ) strengthens the claims for <START:ceramic> buffware <END> specialization along the Gila River and the broad- scale distribution of the decorated pots from there .
How many Gila River settlements may have participated in <START:ceramic> buffware <END> manufacture , and if Grewe was one of them are still to be determined .
For instance , during the Sedentary period , approxim ately 5 percent of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ceramics in Canal System 2 , on the north side of the river , contained mica schist ( Abbott 1988 , 1997 , 1998b ; Henderson 1987a ; Mitchell and Lane 1990 ) .
At Los Hornos , on the south side of the valley and closer to the Gila River sources , the frequencies of mica schist- tempered <START:ceramic> plainware <END> apparently varied across the site ( see Abbott 1998a ) .
The mica schist variety represented more than 90 percent of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery , indicating that the settlem ent’s inhabitants were primarily dependent on the potters to the south for their domestic inventories ( Abbott 1995a ) .
It would seem that the flow of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery from the Gila to the Salt River area was an aspect of Colonial period exchange networks as well .
Finally , there are good reasons , as discussed above , to assume that <START:ceramic> buffware <END> production was largely centralized in the middle Gila River valley , where artisans labored to supply Phoenix area residents and people elsewhere with decorated pottery .
<START:ceramic> Buffware <END> output steadily declined during the Sedentary period , but probably thousands of decorated pots were sent northward from the G ila River sources to Salt River com m unities during that time .
<START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> ceramics typically accounted for around 30 percent of the total pottery assem blage at sites throughout the Phoenix area during the beginning of the Sacaton phase ( e .g. , Abbott 1988 , 1997 , 1998a ; Henderson 1987a ; L indauer 1993 ) .
Three supply zones w ere in the lower Salt River valley , and producers specializing in decorated containers and others making some forms of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> jars were situated in the middle Gila region .
This unmistakable uniform ity among the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> assemblages at both middle Gila and lower Salt R iver villages implies a brisk trade in painted pots and awell-organized distribution network that was more structured and com prehensive than simple down-the-line or other occasional and elem entary forms of exchange .
The case for Gila River <START:ceramic> plainware <END> in the lower Salt River valley may have been different from that of the decorated ware .
Perhaps the Gila River <START:ceramic> plainware <END> producers regularly packed up loads of their wares and visited Phoenix area villages on the southern margin of the valley .
As noted above , the frequency and vessel forms of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery in the lower Salt River valley assem blages diverged from those expecta­ tions .
The distribution of Gila River <START:ceramic> plainware <END> pottery in the Salt River region also was not clustered around central sites , although , unlike the <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots , they were unequally represented in different parts of the valley .
From the perspective of elite control , it is also difficult to imagine how the production and/or distribution of <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pottery could have been manipu­ lated for chiefly gain .
In this regard , we should note that brown-paste copies of red-on-buff pots were made in the Phoenix area at tim es when <START:ceramic> buffware <END> supplies were low ( i .e . , the early Colonial and Classic periods [Abbott 1988 ; Abbott , ed . , 1994 ) .
The extensive ballcourt network and the possible calendrical sequencing of the ritual ball games associated with it ( W ilcox and Sternberg 1983 ) may have evened out the distribution of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> pots and other com modities that entered the exchange netw ork from one or a few villages .
Nonetheless , the large number of ballcourts and the capacious territorial expanse across which the ritual ball games were played imply a fundam ental im portance of the ballcourt activities to H ohokam society and its potential influence on other aspects of Hohokam life , perhaps including the distribution of dom estic supplies and com modities such as <START:ceramic> plainware <END> and <START:ceramic> buffware <END> vessels .
Another <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ja r form came from production sources on the opposite side of the Salt River , and a few Gila R iver <START:ceramic> plainware <END> jars found their way to the Canal System 2 villages .
Finally , <START:ceramic> buffware <END> bowls and some jars were also imported from the Gila River area ( Abbott 1998b ) .
Moreover , these different <START:ceramic> plainware <END> varieties ( i .e . , other schist , silver phyllite , other phyllite ) composed only sm all portions of the overall plainw are assemblage .
The majority of the Grewe pottery was <START:ceramic> plainware <END> tempered with mica schist , and we do not know if there w ere different vessel forms within that set that each originated in a differ ­ ent production area .
While our attempts failed to yield interpretable results , our efforts can serve to identify some of the prob­ lems that m ust be overcom e prior to future successful studies of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> standardization .
Haury ( 1976 :194— 197 ) discovered and described a work area at Snaketown devoted to the production of <START:ceramic> buffware <END> ceramics .
Unfortunately , extracting uncontam inated and representative samples of the schist for ICPS assays from <START:ceramic> buffware <END> sherds has proved im possible ( see Chapter 2 ) .

Starting from the premise that <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> was most frequent in the Tonto basin and Globe-Miami areas , he ( Schmidt 1928:281 ) suggested that : It may be assumed that the appearance of the Gila ware in the Lower Salt region was accompanied by a new , though certainly short-lived culture epoch .
In a footnote ( Schmidt 1928:281 ) he took a somewhat stronger position : ...judging from the [ Los Muertos]...photographs [taken by Frank Cushing ] in settlements of the Lower Salt region cremation is associated with the old Lower Salt [ R ed-on-buff ] ware , inhumation with the more recent <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> , and it must be admitted that these criteria speak decidedly for a dual occupation .
Matting impressions were found in the southeast quarter on the floor and <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> was present below the roof ( or wall ) fall .
5 . Classic ceramics are scarce , but their distribution suggests the persistence of several Sedentary courtyard groups into the period when <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> pottery was made .
No <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> and only a few sherds of <START:ceramic> Salt Red <END> are reported ( Yablon 1981 :170 ) .
However , it has recently been established that <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> does occur in cremations with <START:ceramic> Sacaton Red-on-buff <END> ( Abbott 1983 ) .
A stratigraphic sequence seems to be present , the occurrence of <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> marking a late Classic Phase and the low frequency of decorated ware , which includes at least two sherds of <START:ceramic> Santa Cruz Red-on-buff <END> , indicating the original period of this mound’s growth .

2. The presence of <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> in the upper levels of Mound 2 may mean that it continued to be used into the late Classic .
Micaceous <START:ceramic> plainware <END> is nearly identical with Micaceous Red-on-buff .
The division called Olla consists of a very course , thick <START:ceramic> plainware <END> suited only to water storage .
The balance of the <START:ceramic> plainware <END> is listed under the heading " Others " ( slightly edited ) .
The incised scroll is characteristic of <START:ceramic> Sweetwater Red-on-gray <END> , for example , and the " carelessly slashed " incisions probably refer to Gila Butte Red-on-buff .
His Ultra Red-on-buff possibly was <START:ceramic> Tanque Verde Red-on-brown <END> or other Tucson basin Red-on-Browns ( see Kelly 1978 ) .
Some of the types , such as <START:ceramic> Tanque Verde Red-on-brown <END> , could be somewhat later , or earlier , than shown .
Information taken from Table 4.4 has been added to Midvale’s original figure and I have inferred the presence of four general cultural strata as follows : Stratum A: Base of the mound : this zone contains high frequencies of both incised or micaceous Red-on-buff pottery and micaceous <START:ceramic> plainware <END> .

Incised Red-on-buff and micaceous <START:ceramic> plainware <END> are increasingly frequent in levels IX to XV , implying an early Colonial or Pioneer Period age .
Finally , it is worth noting that the deepest levels (XIV and XV ) in W6 contained only a few incised sherds and micaceous <START:ceramic> plainware <END> ( Table 4.6 ) .
Together with the report of Vahki Plain and <START:ceramic> Estrella Red-on-gray <END> pottery by Peter Pilles ( 1967 ) north of St . Luke’s Hospital , the data from Wl , W2 , and W6 lead to the inference that the original center of the early Pioneer settlement was in the area under the Hospital and immediately around it .
While almost impossible to interpret , it is noteworthy that polychrome was found only in the levels of " Room 13 " and that incised Red-on-buff and micaceous <START:ceramic> plainware <END> were most frequent in the lowest levels of " Room 12 ." A cross-section of the mound ( Figure 4.2 ) shows the relationship of the test pit below Rooms 3 and 8 to other features of the mound .

3. G ila Plain refers to sand-tem pered , mixed tem pered varieties of <START:ceramic> Gila Plain <END> .
The two red-on-brown sherds may have been <START:ceramic> Tanque Verde Red-on-brown <END> .
However , Midvale’s ( 1941a ) notes indicate explicitly that a Classic sherd was associated with Floor 9 , and level 18 ( Floor 8 ) still has a relatively high percentage of <START:ceramic> Gila Red <END> , though this could mean a late Sedentary Period age .
The ceramics from these levels are characterized by relatively high frequencies of <START:ceramic> Vahki Red <END> , thin micaceous <START:ceramic> plainware <END> , and late Pioneer decorated sherds .
96 __ _ _ __END___PAGE__ _ _ _ _ The architectural style and the probable <START:ceramic> Tanque Verde Red-on-brown <END> pottery on the floor imply that this house dated to the Classic Period .
In the first place , the decorated ceramics ( <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> , Hopi yellowware ) found in Rooms 7 and 30 and areas 13 and 14 provide specific additional evidence for the late Classic age of the roomblock .
The Escalante mound and its pithouse were probably built during the early Classic Period ( Doyel 1981:39 ) , but the presence of <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> in the coursed-caliche architecture shows that it probably dates to the late Classic .
In the eastern courtyard , " a three-quarter grooved axe and a small <START:ceramic> Tonto Polychrome <END> jar were recovered ...and two burials were found in the fill below the surface " ( Doyel 1981:33 ) .
Both sets have burials with no artifacts , with only a redware bowl , or with many artifacts that include both <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> , redware vessels , and shell artifacts .
The body was covered with hematite , a chunk of which was found under a <START:ceramic> Salt Red Smudged <END> bowl [B12-2] located to the right of the cranium ...Of course , the projectile point may simply have been included with the burial goods .
Whether there was also an " XX " series of burial excavations is unclear ; however , the BraMe catalog does record a <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> bowl from XX7 ( A4-8 ) , the only reference to this series I could find .
Also at Los Muertos , 28 <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> vessels were found with inhumations , 18 in rooms and only six with cremations ( Haury 1945 :64 ) .
The differential distributions of <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> and other artifacts associated with inhumations at Los Muertos are real and require explanation .
The presence of fairly large quantities of <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> and intrusive ceramics in the Phoenix basin indicates the renewal or intensification of extralocal ties during the Civano Phase with adjacent local systems , particularly with those in the Tonto basin , the Globe-Miami area , and points north and east .
Interestingly , however , the mound did contain a large number of rich burials and three of them were associated with <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> .
Unfortunately , although noting that <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> was associated with both males and females , and young and old , Haury does not report the frequency distributions and other associations ( Haury 1945 :43 ) .
Most of the turquoise mosaic frogs and birds occur in sites involved in the Salado interaction sphere ( though it should be noted that little or no <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> is found in the Middle Verde or Flagstaff areas ) .
<START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> ( which may have been made locally ) was found in rooms and burials on the mound and in a pithouse and a burial off the mound .
Judging by the total absence of <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> in the fill of any of the mound phases , the mound reached its maximum extent before the beginning of the Civano Phase .
