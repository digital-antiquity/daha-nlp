Starting from the premise that <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome  <END>   was most frequent in the Tonto basin and Globe-Miami areas, he (Schmidt 1928:28 1) suggested that: It may be assumed that the appearance of the <START:ceramic>  Gila ware  <END>  in the Lower Salt region was accompanied by a new, though certainly short-lived culture epoch.
In a footnote (Schmidt 1928:281) he took a somewhat stronger position: ...judging from the [Los Muertos]...photographs [taken by Frank Cushing] in settlements of the Lower Salt region cremation is associated with the old Lower Salt [Red-on-buff] ware, inhumation with the more recent <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> , and it must be admitted that these criteria speak decidedly for a dual occupation.
Imported decorated pottery such as <START:ceramic> White Mountain Red ware <END> , <START:ceramic> Jeddito and Awatovi Black-on-yellow <END>, <START:ceramic> Gila and Tonto polychromes <END> , and <START:ceramic> Tusayan Black-on-white <END> from Puebloan and Salado groups in northeastern Arizona appears at sites in the Verde Confederacy in variable frequencies (North and Foster, 2002, p. 11; Stone, 2000, p. 208; Wilcox and Holmlund, 2007, p. 105).
Creek area are poorly understood, primarily because nearly all of the pottery from that area and across the upland tracts north of the lower Salt River valley has been lumped into a single type, <START:ceramic> Wingfield Plain <END> .
The Fort Mountain analysis contributed to an on-going ceramic research program in the northern territory that is working to establish ceramic provenance-related distinctions in the  <START:ceramic> Wingfield Plain <END> pottery.
For instance, previous analyses of <START:ceramic> Wingfield Plain <END> pottery have documented variation in surface color, smoothing, and polishing (e.g. Henderson and Rodgers 1979:92-94; Weaver 1974:25-34).
Of note, during my reanalysis of the pottery collected by LaFollette from AZ T:8:5(ASM), I encountered several phyllite-tempered pieces that were labeled as " <START:ceramic>  Wingfield Red <END> ."
Plain ware sherds had a brown paste and were neither slipped red nor painted. Red ware sherds were distinguished by an oxidized iron-rich slip. Buff ware pottery included the  <START:ceramic> Hohokam red-on-buff <END> decorated types described by Haury (1945, 1976).
Sharp shoulders are common on <START:ceramic> Hohokam red-on-buff <END> vessels from the middle and late portions of the Sedentary period (Wallace 2001), but that jar form was rarely present among plain ware vessels except during the Classic period.
