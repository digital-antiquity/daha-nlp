Starting from the premise that <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome  <END>   was most frequent in the Tonto basin and Globe-Miami areas, he (Schmidt 1928:28 1) suggested that: It may be assumed that the appearance of the <START:ceramic>  Gila ware  <END>  in the Lower Salt region was accompanied by a new, though certainly short-lived culture epoch.
In a footnote (Schmidt 1928:281) he took a somewhat stronger position: ...judging from the [Los Muertos]...photographs [taken by Frank Cushing] in settlements of the Lower Salt region cremation is associated with the old Lower Salt [Red-on-buff] ware, inhumation with the more recent <START:ceramic> Gila Polychrome <END> , and it must be admitted that these criteria speak decidedly for a dual occupation.
